Introduction.sec=CommonAccord is legal relationships expressed as "objects," like software.  All of the text, and the little bit of code that brings it together, is on <a href="http://github.com/CommonAccord/Cmacc-Org">GitHub</a>.  This website uses a parser done by <a href="https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/pdefilippi">Primavera</a>.  The parser implements a "multiple, prefixed, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming">prototypal inheritance"</a> model developed over some years of experimentation.  <b>All</b> materials and all solutions are based on the same paradigm - each file has a list of attributes that references some other files, and can itself be referenced.<br>These texts allow people to transact by connecting dots (files/nodes), and let the legal system get "on the same page," codify documents as we work, saving and sharing the non-confidential parts.<br>This is a good fit with P2P transacting systems.  With Thomas Hardjono, <a href="http://hardjono.mit.edu/sites/default/files/documents/CommonAccord_Provenance_11182015.pdf">we describe a stack of such files, blockchain and "UMA"</a>.<br>The system can also be used on its own, as a document generation system or as a resource for texts.<br>A taste of the "experience" of working this way can be seen  in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZfsyTPYFIA">YouTube video</a>.<br>To facilitate contributions, the <a href="index.php?action=list&file=/Wx/">Wx/ folder</a> mirrors web domain names and the <a href="index.php?action=list&file=/GHx/">GHx/ folder</a> mirrors GitHub account names.<br><br>Our most recent work is for MIT Future of Commerce, a <a href="index.php?action=list&file=/GH/FutureCommerce/ULOM/Bryan/Demo">Universal License Object Model</a> with UMKC Law and Code for Kansas City.
