Introduction.sec=CommonAccord is legal documents expressed like software.  All of the text, and the little bit of code that brings the text together, is on <a href="http://github.com/CommonAccord">GitHub</a>.  This website uses a parser done by <a href="https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/pdefilippi">Primavera</a>.  The parser implements a "multiple, prefixed, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming">prototypal inheritance"</a> model developed over some years of experimentation.  <b>All</b> materials and all solutions are based on exactly the same paradigm - every document is a list of attributes that references some other lists of attributes, and can itself be referenced, etc.<br>These texts allow the legal profession to get "on the same page," to codify documents as we work, saving and sharing the non-confidential parts that may be repeatedly useful.<br>This is a good fit with P2P transacting systems, such as <a href="https://goo.gl/lOs5Fg">digital currency</a>.  But the system can also be used on its own, as a document (or relationship) generation and management system, or can be used just as a resource for texts.<br>A taste of the "experience" of working this way can be seen  in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZfsyTPYFIA">YouTube video</a><br>To facilitate contributions, the <a href="index.php?action=list&file=/Wx/">Wx/ folder</a> mirrors web domain names and the <a href="index.php?action=list&file=/GHx/">GHx/ folder</a> mirrors GitHub account names.<br><br>The project has been an open secret.  We hope that with the better organization that you see here, help from the community, and a focus on startup docs to get started, the legal world can begin to converge on shared pages.<br>   An immediate focus is startup company legal "objects" that can be "instantiated" by term sheets that render into full documents and closing binders.   

FormDoc.sec=When you click on the first link below, you will see a YCombinator SAFE note, for Acme.  It is, of course, only an example, intended to be adapted and extended.
