Introduction.sec=CommonAccord is legal documents expressed like software.  All of the meat is on <a href="http://github.com/CommonAccord">GitHub</a>.  This website uses a tiny parser done by <a href="https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/pdefilippi">Primavera</a>.  The parser implements a "multiple, prefixed, prototype inheritance" model developed over some years of experimentation.  <b>All</b> materials and all solutions are based on exactly the same paradigm - my document is a list of attributes that references some other lists of attributes.<br>These texts allow the legal profession to get "on the same page," to codify documents as we work, saving and sharing the non-confidential parts that may be repeatedly useful. <br>This is a good fit with P2P transacting systems, such as digital currency.  But the system can also be used on its own, as a document generation and management system, or can be used just as a resource for texts.  <br>An immediate focus is startup company legal "objects" that can be "instantiated" by term sheets that render into full documents and closing binders. <br>To facilitate contributions, the <a href="index.php?action=list&file=/Wx/">Wx/ folder</a> mirrors web domain names and the <a href="index.php?action=list&file=/GHx/">GHx/ folder</a> mirrors GitHub account names.
