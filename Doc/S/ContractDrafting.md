On Contract Drafting:

This site is dedicated to improving contract.  Practically, that means improving contract drafting.  We use a structured approach to document drafting and the sharing platform of coders. Everything here is open source.

We aim to be entirely open in spirit as well - to be open to new ideas, differences of practice and opinion, as well as context.  We will however also seek to advance agreement by making specific suggestions.  These specific suggestions should be understood as "questions posed in the form of answers," aka "tools, not rules."

In this introduction, we will touch very quickly on some basic problems of contract texts, then leap directly into an explanation of what we mean by a "structured" approach to legal documents, using a set of specific recommendations.  Please take the recommendations and examples in the spirit in which they are offered - as tools, not rules, as minimum viable solutions seeking to inspire improvement, contradiction, broadening, generalization.


Background:

Contract agreements are a kind of "law of the parties" - they express the expectations and provide for contingencies, most of which are unexpected and undesired by the parties.  Properly done, they clarify expectations, invite pre-deal diligence, appropriate monitoring, effective resolution of disputes.

Making and managing such agreements is a major concern of businesses and government agencies.  Drafting them is a core activity of lawyers. 


On Structure:

Drafting can be understood as layers.  At each layer, there is a list of issues to be addressed, and a variety of answers.

Starting with the most fundamental layer - the notion of a contract document - there are a few fundamentals.  A contract agreement must contain i) a heading with title, ii) identification of the parties, iii) optionally a statement of background and objectives (why), iv) a declaration of engagement, v) the engagements, vi) a declaration of signature, vii) signatures and viii) attachments, if any.  In a structured system, this is expressed as an object - with a single link.

The engagements are expressed as an outline, with sections and subsections.  It is very useful to have headings on the sections and on the subsections that are more than a line or two.  There is great variation in the organization of the outline of engagements.  Some prefer many sections - numbering up to 30 or even more.  Others prefer fewer main headings.  A radical approach advocated by some is to organize into just a few main headings based on the principal audience - the parties or their lawyers - in order to focus attention.  An extreme version of this is to have a short business agreement with a short but comprehensive statement of the transaction and a long annex of details and legal issues.  Inversely, in some circumstances, parties will sign a master agreement of general terms and then do actual business under purchase orders or statements of work.  At the extreme, this is how most of e-commerce is done - the customers accept terms of use and then do transactions.

All of these can be expressed as objects.  For purposes of this discussion we will assume a very short top outline, where the terms are organized into a few major topics based on the audience.  Basically, i) the business terms, ii) the business mechanics, iii) the legal mechanics and iv) the terms often called "Miscellaneous" that relate to the mechanics of the agreement itself.

In addition, there must be a section on "definitions."   Definitions play multiple roles in legal agreements.  Some provide a background and precision for terms used in the agreement.  An "Affiliate" of a party can for instance be defined with some precision to include or exclude small ownership interests in another company.  Some provide a shorthand for ideas developed in the Agreement.  In some cases, defined terms act as what coders would call "parameters."  For instance, "Price" could be defined to be "$15,000" and "Delivery Date" could be defined as October 15, 2019.

There are also a number of variations in where terms are defined.  In more formal, longer agreements, there is commonly a section entitled "Definitions."  This is often the first section of an agreement, but that of course makes the reader wade through them before getting to the actual engagements, so sometimes they are at the end of the agremeent or even as an attachment. But there is also a practice of defining terms in the course of the agreement and then dropping a parenthesis and the term  (hereinafter "in-line").  Some agreements mix these approaches, with a tendency to define in-line terms that are used in particular sections of the agreement.  This occasionally raises the issue of "scope" - if a term is defined in-line in one section, does that meaning carry over to other sections?  It also can create inconvenience for the reader in finding the defined term.  Sometimes a section of defined terms will include references to the sections in which in-line terms are defined.

When using a defined term, it is common but not universal practice to use Initial Capitals for the Defined Term.  There is a hesitation to capitalize verbs as oppose to Nouns.  Of course, ambiguities can arise when the defined term is at the beginning of a sentence or when one defined term is immediately followed by another.




Collaboration:

Git and GitHub enable a much more structured approach to contract drafting and to collaboration - both within a transaction and across the ecosystem of contract drafters.
