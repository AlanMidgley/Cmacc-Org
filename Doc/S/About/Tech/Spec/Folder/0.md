Ti=Smart Folders

0.sec=A very useful extension would be "smart" Folders.

1.sec=For example, to handle the mass of possibilities currently at Z/..., and these are only a few of the possibilities.

2.sec=A smart folder could intercept the request for a file and return a (calculated) Record.

3.sec=Of course, smart Folders would respect the object model.  An actual Record would have precedence over a calculated one.
