1.Ti=Expansion of a Value

1.1.sec=A "Document" is the result of rendering a "Record".

1.2.sec=Rendering is done by expanding the Value of a specified Key - by default it is currently "Model.Root" - with {plugs} in the Value expanded, recursively.

1.3.sec=Plugs are expanded by literal matching with the Plug name with the first matching Key name in the namespace of the Record.

2.Ti=The Key namespace of a Record

2.0.sec=The Key namespace of a Record1 is:

2.1.sec=the Keys in Record1,

2.2.0.sec=the Keys in each RecordN referenced as a Value in Record1,

2.2.1.sec=If a RecordN is referenced by an empty Key, the Keys and Values are included as is.  If a RecordN is referenced by a Key which has a name,  "prefixing" is applied to the Keys and the Plugs in RecordN.  E.g., a reference Foo.=[Record2] means that a Key/Value of "Bar=My {Name}."  would be evaluated as FooBar=My {BarName}.  If a Key called "BarName" is not found, the prefix is removed and "Name" is tried.  This deprefixing is both (i) essential in many uses, and (ii) a consequence of the object model.

2.3.sec=recursively, depth-first.

00.sec=The order of Keys in a Record is significant.  A Record may contain more than one Key with the same name - the top one has priority.  Multiple Key/Values is of minor use, except that it is essential to respect the order of referenced Records.  It is common to reference a number of RecordNs via the same Key, notably with an empty Key.
