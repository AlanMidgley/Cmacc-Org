Ti=Tech:

1.Ti=Packages ("Cmacclets")

1.0.sec=A set of files organized as Doc/; File/; view/; and vendor.  

1.1.sec=Doc/ has Cmacc text.  (Should it be called "Cmacc/").

1.2.sec=view/ and vendor/ are technical; view and controller versus model; verbs as opposed to nouns. 

1.00.sec=The goal is to be able to community a data package - for instance an a/v work or a medical scan - with accompanying text and functions.

5.Ti=Smart Folders

5.0.sec=A very useful expansion would be a "smart" Folder.

5.1.sec=For example, to handle the mass of possibilities currently at Z/....  These are only a few of the possibilities.

5.2.sec=They could be replaced by a bit of code (a smart Folder) that intercepted the request for a file and returned a calculated Record.

5.3.sec=Of course, particular Records in the folder could be overridden in the usual way.
