Ti=Extensions

0.sec=The following seem necessary extensions to parsing:

1.sec=There needs to be a naming convention for the _second, and _third_, etc. highest priority Key in the Record's namespace.  Foo=This value used to say: {Foo//-1}.

2.sec=The namespace of Records can be augmented by specifying another Root.  This additional Root2 adds to the namespace of the Root in the same way that referencing a Record2 adds to the namespace of a Record.  The Root2 is treated as having higher priority than the basic Root.

00.sec=It is desired to keep the functions and syntax very simple.
