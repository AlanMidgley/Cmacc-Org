Ti=An EU project.

0.sec=The scope of the project could be something like a P2P transacting system consisting of: 

1.sec=a rendering engine based on Cmacc inheritance;

2.sec=an interface for casual use on phone or laptop;

3.sec=interface for power-user, perhaps a "mode" for a standard IDE; figure out git workflow, etc.; 

4.sec=access management;

5.sec=tools for the individual to have most of their materials securely hosted, and "carry" only a small amount on their device;

6.0.sec=examples of:

6.1.sec=interactions between two individuals where the transaction has the flow of signing a check - e.g. is validated by each of their hosts;

6.2.sec=examples of privacy-preserving requests to the core;

6.=[Z/ol/s2]

7.sec=GDPR and DSP2 compliant set of documents for transfers - with multi-lingual equivalences in six languages. 

00.sec=The system could be hosted by anyone, but the working hypothetical is that it would be hosted by a bank.
