Provisional Title:  "Digital Ledgers, Chains and Law".

Provisional Date:  May 26-27 - at MIT Media Lab

Organizers: Thomas Hardjono and James Hazard  (commonaccord@gmail.com)


Bitcoin, blockchain and the Open Ledger Initiative have launched a dynamic in which systems of transacting are converging, becoming standardized and open-sourced.  The convergence applies to software and can apply to legal text, the original kind of "code."  The point of convergence could be a common record format and shared "object model".

Transacting will become more rapid and secure.  It could become more democratic, but will disrupt incumbents and institutions.

The conference will explore the techniques, uses and consequences of a transparent transacting platform.  We imagine it as a potluck, with participants bringing things they have made to share.
