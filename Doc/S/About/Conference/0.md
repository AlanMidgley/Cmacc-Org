Provisional Title:  "Digital Contracts, Ledgers and Blockchains".

Organizers: Thomas Hardjono and James Hazard


Bitcoin, blockchain and the Open Ledger Initiative have launched a dynamic in which systems of transacting are converging, being standardized and open sourced.  The convergence applies to both software and legal "code."  It presents an opportunity to make transacting more secure and democratic, but will disrupt incumbents and institutions.

The conference will explore the techniques, uses and consequences of transparent transacting platforms.
