Provisional Title:  "Digital Contracts, Ledgers and Blockchains".

Provisional Date:  May 26-27 - at MIT Media Lab

Organizers: Thomas Hardjono and James Hazard  (commonaccord@gmail.com)


Bitcoin, blockchain and the Open Ledger Initiative have launched a dynamic in which systems of transacting are converging, becoming standardized and open-sourced.  The convergence applies to software and can apply to legal text, the original kind of "code."  It presents an opportunity to make transacting more secure and democratic, but will disrupt incumbents and change institutions.

The conference will explore the techniques, uses and consequences of a transparent transacting platform.
