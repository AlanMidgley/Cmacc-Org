Ti=Object Model for a legal World

0.sec="Object model" is a mouthful for many.  In the context of CommonAccord, it can be understood as the organization of files on a hard drive  At the top level, we have something like:

1.sec=<a href="index.php?action=list&file=U/id/">Persons</a> (individuals, legal persons, roles and pseudonyms)

2.sec=<a href="index.php?action=list&file=U/at/">Places</a>

3.sec=<a href="index.php?action=list&file=U/is/">Properties</a>

4.sec=Forms <a href="index.php?action=list&file=Wx/">from websites</a> and <a href="index.php?action=list&file=GHx/">from repositories</a>. 

5.sec=There are of course refinements such as <a href="index.php?action=source&file=U/class/ID_She">female</a>, and composites such as transactions or <a href="index.php?action=source&file=Wx/gov/uscourts/cand/model-protective-orders/Patent/Demo_ProtectiveOrder_0.md">cases</a>.

90.sec=We suggest <a href="index.php?action=list&file=">one organization of the folders</a>, but this needs much more attention.<br><br><img src="https://github.com/CommonAccord/Cmacc-Org/blob/master/File/Doc/S/About/Conference/Flyer/Legal_ObjectModel.jpg" height="300" width="500">
