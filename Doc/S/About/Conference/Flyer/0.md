Intro.1.sec=Bitcoin, blockchain and the Open Ledger Initiative have launched a dynamic in which systems of transacting are converging, becoming standardized and open-sourced.  The convergence applies to payments and software, and it can also apply to legal text, the original kind of "code."  

Intro.2.sec=The <a href="index.php?action=doc&file=S/About/Conference/Stack/Hourglass_0.md">point of convergence</a> could be a common record format and shared object model.

Intro.3.sec=The conference will explore the techniques, uses and consequences of a transparent transacting platform.  We imagine it as a collaboration and potluck, with participants presenting things that work together.
