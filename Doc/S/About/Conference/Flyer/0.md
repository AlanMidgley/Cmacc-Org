Intro.Ti=Introduction

Intro.1.sec=Bitcoin, blockchain and the Open Ledger Initiative have launched a dynamic in which systems of transacting are converging, becoming standardized and open-sourced.  The convergence applies to payments and software, and it can also apply to legal text, the original kind of "code."  The point of convergence could be a common record format and shared object model.

Intro.2.sec=Transacting will become more rapid and secure.  It could become more democratic, but will disrupt incumbents and institutions.

Intro.3.sec=The conference will explore the techniques, uses and consequences of a transparent transacting platform.  We imagine it as a collaboration and potluck, with participants presenting things they have contributed.
