Ti=Status - Convergence of Blockchain, Legal and Access Security

0.sec=A number of currents are converging:

1.sec=Interest in blockchain has spurred development of P2P transacting platforms.  Among other efforts, the Linux Foundation's {HLP} brings together many actors to agree on a common platform.

2.sec=CommonAccord has a data model (Cmacc) that can extend blockchain solutions to all legal relationships and be a bridge for integration with legacy systems such as Word (legal), ECM and ERM.

3.sec=There is a strong tradition of legal codification via bar and trade groups, agencies and clinics, and  now also legal "hackers".

4.sec=Decentralized access control based on OAuth and related technologies is widely used and well-understood.

90.sec=The combination of Blockchain/Cmacc/Access is ripe for open-source iteration.
