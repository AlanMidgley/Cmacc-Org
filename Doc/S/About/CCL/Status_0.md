1.Ti=Convergence of Hyperledger, Legal and IT Security

1.0.sec=A number of movements are converging:

1.1.sec=The {HLP} brings together a plurality of the most important actors in transacting to agree on a common P2P platform.

1.2.sec=CommonAccord has a data model (Cmacc) that can extend Hyperledger to all legal relationships and be a standard for integration with legacy systems such as Word (legal), ECM and ERM.

1.3.sec=There is a well-established tradition of legal codification, including bar and trade groups, agencies, and legal clinics.

1.4.sec=Access control based on OAuth is very well-widely used and well understood. 

1.90.sec=The combination of Cmacc/Access/Blockchain has not been implemented but appears ripe for open-source iteration.

2.Ti={CCL}

2.sec=There is currently no legal structure to hold the shared legal text, which we expect to become the global component of a legal operating system. Nor are there national or trade-sector equivalents.  Creating a structure, tentatively called the "{CCL}" is purpose of this proposal, and an expected focus of the conference at MIT on May 23-24.

3.Ti=Proponents
