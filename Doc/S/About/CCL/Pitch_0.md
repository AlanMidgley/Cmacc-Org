Ti=<center>Proposal - Request for Support<br>{CCL}</center>

1.Ti=Problem

1.1.sec=Legal compliance and optimisation is expensive, slow and uncertain. 

1.2.sec=Enterprise security is weak.

1.3.sec=Business and governance are highly centralized, increasingly winner takes most.

1.4.sec=Matters of great general importance that do not map to existing institutions are difficult to advance on. 

1.5.sec=Blockchain is creating disruption by enabling standards-based automation, but the technology does not address legal or privacy concerns.

2.Ti=Solution

2.1.sec=A secure, “DRY”, peer-to-peer, open source transacting system based on a common record format, a common “object model”, cryptographically based access control, and users’ choice of communication protocols.

2.2.sec=Collaboration on legal documents using the infrastructure of software code:  git, GitHub, html and editors.

2.3.sec=A {CCL} to assist codification efforts, coordinate with national and sector equivalents, and provide a forum for governance.

3.Ti=Impact

3.1.sec=Transparency in the legal process; improved access to justice; greater legal certainty; greater productivity; advancement of agendas such as collaborative governance, rule of law, privacy, carbon-reduction and medical research and treatment. 

3.2.sec=Greater security and robustness of IT systems for individuals, enterprise and government.

3.3.sec=Greater transparency of infrastructure, such as banks, governments and supply chains.

4.Ti=Sauce

4.1.sec=A uniquely simple record format that has the power of multiple prototype inheritance in a "graph" object model.

4.2.sec=Fit with OAuth-UMA security approach.

4.3.sec=Codification of legal materials.

4.4.sec=7-15 years of efforts and thought-leadership regarding the need for a source-based approach to legal codification.

4.5.sec=A growing group of thought leaders and organizations that will come together for on May 23-24, 2016.

5.Ti=Team

5.1.sec=Founder: James Hazard

5.2.sec=Discussion partners:  Marc Dangeard, Thomas Hardjono, ….

6.Ti=Status

6.1.sec=A mature solution: after roughly 7 years of iteration, CommonAccord has a stable data model (Cmacc) and many examples of solutions to legal document problems.  OAuth is a well-established authentication technology with additional layers of user-managed-access.  Blockchains are new, but extremely powerful technologies with very broad awareness and development efforts. 

6.2.sec=There is currently no legal structure to hold the shared legal text, which we expect to become the global component of a legal “operating system”. Nor are there national or trade-sector equivalents.  Creating a structure, tentatively called the "{CCL}" is the purpose of this proposal, and an expected focus of the conference at MIT on May 23-24.

7.Ti=Plan

7.1.Ti=Conference - MIT - Digital Contracts, Identities & Blockchains

7.1.1.sec=Presentations and discussions with participants and stakeholders

7.1.2.sec=Collaboration leading up to the conference.  Inclusion of experts, iteration of solutions.

7.1.=[Z/ol/s2]

7.2.Ti={CCL}

7.1.sec=Establish Advisory board composed of representatives from expert and constituent groups.

7.2.sec=Propose three legs - America, Europe, Asia.  Search for collaborations with universities, associations, regulators, national authorities, hacker groups, incubators.

7.3.sec=Identify local leaders to bring the local Centers to life.

7.4.sec=Launch at least in Europe and North America in the first year.

7.5.sec=Prepare a follow up conference to share the results.

7.=[Z/ol/s5]

8.Ti=Ask

8.1.sec=Financial and structuring support for a {CCL}.

8.2.sec=Budget for travel: putting together the Center will require coordination with organizations that are spread across Europe and the US.  An estimated {Travel.$} will be spent on travel.

8.3.sec=Budget for coding:  the current parser should be re-written, layers of access control, interface and API need to be established. An estimated {Code.$} will be spent on coding.

8.4.sec=Additional budget for the Centers in Europe and North America will be addressed separately after candidates have been identified to host Centers in these locations.  This additional budget will cover office space and salaries for the initial team(s).
