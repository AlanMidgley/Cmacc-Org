3.sec=Jumping into multiple file systems.  The best way to handle that now seems to be to do it in parallel to the way that we handle inclusion of other files.  As each key/value in a file has higher priority than key/values in referenced files, so a reference to a file should be satisfied from the local file system, but if not found, then can be obtained from a referenced file system.  So, one could have a small file system of one's own stuff, and reference another file system as something like:<ul><li>CmA_=[[http://commonaccord.org/Doc/]]</ul>This would have the effect of including all the CommonAccord files with a prefix of CmA_.
