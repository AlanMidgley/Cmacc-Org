Ti=Overview

1.sec=CommonAccord handles documents more efficiently than other systems.  It expresses all documents as leaves on a tree, all of which trace back to trunks of codified materials.  The key innovation is a list-based approach to text "objects."  By radically simplifying the key notions of programming, this extends to all users the advantages of programming.  It permits the demystification of both law and IT.

2.0.sec=Expressing documents in CommonAccord format enables: 

2.1.sec=The legal profession to "get on the same page."  Via model document projects and contributions from interested parties, it is possible to achieve consistency and continuous improvement in the same way that software is developed.

2.2.sec=Parties to negotiate from public models.

2.3.sec=Efficient management of the legal function.  Creation of new documents is a matter of additional parameters on an existing ones.  This makes it easy to supervise, to prepare reports, to identify trends and anomalies.

2.4.sec=Efficient operation of marketplaces.  An ideal market allows participants to transact by negotiating only deal points. Inclusion allows any transaction to serve as a precedent for others.  By eliminating the cost of reproducing a precedent, patterns of use can sharpen and become quasi-standards.

2.5.sec=Decentralization of decision-making.  By radically reducing the cost, complexity, and opacity of law and IT, it reduces "transaction costs" (Coase) and the advantages of centralization.

3.sec=The CommonAccord document model is compatible with new peer-based transacting platforms such as blockchain and necessary for their extension to the full range of relationships.  When combined with access systems such as UMA (user-managed-access), it provides a complete, simple, open source system of automation.  Because these systems are built with strong encryption and the system is simple, it can be much more secure than the existing complex infrastructure.
