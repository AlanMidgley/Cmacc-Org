Intro.sec=We at Acme - and companies like us - want to do business with you honestly, with a focus on our business and relationship.  The legal part to be thorough and clear, representing best practices.  To speed the legal side, we list documents that we are usually comfortable with.  We know them, our lawyers know them, we can act quickly on them.  If you want to make it easy on both of us, please use one of these forms.  Please make new documents as patches on existing ones.  You will see lots of examples of patches on this site.  If none of these documents is a good starting point, please make your document using this format and the style guide for our community.  This will help us understand and react, and will also mean that we can easily reuse the materials in the future.  If it is worth learning, it is worth remembering.  This may be unfamiliar the first time round, but will make our lives easier and let us focus on one another.
