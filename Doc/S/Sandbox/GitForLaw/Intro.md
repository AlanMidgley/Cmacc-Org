1. Why

Most of legal is collaboration, voluntary in deal making and compelled in litigation.  Most of law is done as documents.  Most legal documents and paradigms (document sets) could be collaboratively sourced in git.  Git is the most efficient and scaled approach to managing document collaboration.  It arose in the software coding environment, where the requirements are more extreme than in law.  

2. Law on Git

By "law" we mean legal documents.  Legal documents could be statutes and regulations, and there are some remarkably achievements in using git for those.  However, most of our focus will be on documents that people and businesses use.  Foremost are contracts, and also permits, organizational documents, even litigation.

Legal documents are the surface of the law, but they are also much of the reality of law, and the substance appears through those documents.

Collaboratively sourcing legal documents could make them radically better, faster, cheaper.  It can permit quasi-codification of them.

A second aspect of legal collaboration for which git is very useful is collaboration on a transaction.  A transaction is a kind of document "project" for which git has great functionality.  A draft term sheet can be proposed.  Negotiations can be done by "pull requests," and internal discussions on each side can be done by forking, in the same way.  The pyramid of collaboration can be as deep and complex as needed.

A third aspect of law where git is useful is teaching.  Course materials can be published in git, class work can be to complete and improve the work, submissions can be by pull request.  Some CS classes, even very large ones, are already taught this way.
