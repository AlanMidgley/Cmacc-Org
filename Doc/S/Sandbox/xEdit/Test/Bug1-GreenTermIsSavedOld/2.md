/=I created the 1.md page, then used dialog box to make this new 2.md.  Then modified "old Value" to be "new Value."  It saved "old Value".  If I make two successive changes then it saves the first change.  So somehow not updated the variable that is being saved.  Same thing happens if you save in the current page. 

Value=<span class="param">old Value</span>
