The following files are the (hypothetical) workflow on a request by Acme's in-house counsel for review and drafting by outside counsel (Quade and Quinn) on this NDA with Fabrakam.
<br>

AcmeGC_v01 is the work that GC has prepared, based on shared standards, and asks Quade to review.

QuadeRequest is the explanation of the assignment by GC for Quade.
<br>

QuadeResponse is a page set up by GC, where we see Quade's response with answers and comments.
<br>

AcmeGC_v2 is for when GC finalizes - accepting, selecting among or rejecting Quade's work.
<br>


In understanding the workflow, the place to start is with the assignment to Quade - QuadeRequest.  That's where the work assignment is.  It links to GC's v01 and to QuadeResponse.
