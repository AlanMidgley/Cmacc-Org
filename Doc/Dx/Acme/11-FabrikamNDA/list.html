The following files are the (hypothetical) workflow on a request by Acme's in-house counsel for review and drafting by outside counsel (QuadeQuinn) on this NDA with Fabrakam.<br>

AcmeGC_v01 is the work that GC asks to have reviewed.


AcmeGC_v2 is for when GC finalizes - accepting, selecting among or rejecting - QuadeQuin's work.<br>

QuadeQuinn is the assignment to them and an invitation to review and repair.<br>


In understanding workflow, the place to start is with QuadeQuinn.  That's where the work assignment is and where QuadeQuinn will do its work, make its pull request.
