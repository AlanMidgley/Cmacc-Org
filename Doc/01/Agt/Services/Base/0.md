1.Ti=Scope Of Agreement

1.sec=This {_Agreement} governs the {_Services}, Deliverables, {_Compensation}, and Expenses provided to Client by {_Service_Provider} pursuant to separate statement(s) of work (each in the “EXHIBIT(S)”) that will reference this {_Agreement} and contain a detailed description of the {_Services} to be performed, any Deliverables that may be provided as a result of the {_Services} and all {_Compensation} and Expenses in exchange for such {_Services} and Deliverables.  Even though {_Service_Provider} may provide Deliverables hereunder, this is a contract for services and not for the sale of goods.
 
2.Ti=Services And Deliverables; Compensation; Expenses.
 
2.1.Ti=Services and Deliverables

2.1.sec=Client hereby retains and engages {_Service_Provider} to perform and deliver, and {_Service_Provider} agrees to perform and deliver, the {_Services} and the Deliverables as set forth in the applicable EXHIBIT(S). {_Service_Provider} may, at its sole discretion, subcontract any part of the {_Services} as necessary to perform the {_Services} and deliver the Deliverables. Client is deemed to have accepted any Service or Deliverable upon the receipt thereof.
 
2.2.Ti=Change(s) to Statement(s) of Work, {_Services} and/or Deliverables

2.2.sec=Any material change in the scope of {_Services}, Deliverables or a phase thereof shall be reduced to writing and signed by the parties in a written change order specifying changes to the specific EXHIBIT.  Neither {_Party} will have any obligation with respect to any work affected by a material change to the scope of {_Services} and/or Deliverables unless agreed to in writing and signed by both Parties.
 
2.3.Ti=Compensation

2.3.1.sec=In consideration and exchange of the {_Services} and Deliverables to be performed by {_Service_Provider} to Client, Client agrees to pay {_Service_Provider} the {_Compensation} as described in the applicable EXHIBIT (“{Def.Compensation.Target}”).
 
2.3.2.sec=Invoicing shall be in accordance with the EXHIBIT (“{Def.Compensation.Target}”).  Any invoices not paid by the Due Date are past due and will be subject to a service charge of {Payment.LateCharge.cl} on the outstanding delinquent balance until such balance is paid in full.  Should it become necessary for {_Service_Provider} to proceed with collection measures against the {_Client} to collect any amounts which are past due, the {_Client} agrees to pay for all reasonable costs of such collection, including court costs and attorney's fees.  If any portion of an invoice is not paid in full by the Due Date, {_Service_Provider} may, at its sole discretion, suspend any or all {_Services} until the outstanding invoices are paid in full. Payments will be applied first to any late fees, next to any direct costs incurred on behalf of {_Service_Provider}, and finally any remainder shall be applied to {_Compensation} and Expenses.

2.4.Ti=Expenses

2.4.sec=Expenses shall be in accordance with the EXHIBIT (“{Def.Compensation.Target}”).

2.5.sec={_Client} assumes responsibility for the accuracy of any information and/or specifications it provides to {_Service_Provider} and agrees that {_Service_Provider} may rely on such information and/or specifications without independent verification for the limited purpose of performing the {_Services} or creating the Deliverables hereunder.  {_Service_Provider} will have no liability (i) to the extent any deficiencies in the {_Services} and/or the Deliverables are the result of {_Client}’s acts, omissions or delays, or (ii) where {_Client} has instructed {_Service_Provider} to perform the {_Services} or create the Deliverables in a particular manner or in accordance with a particular schedule notwithstanding {_Service_Provider}’s contrary advice.

2.=[G/Z/ol/5]

3.Ti=Term; Termination; Survival.
 
3.1.Ti=Term

3.1.sec=Unless terminated otherwise, the term of this {_Agreement} shall commence as of the {_Effective_Date} and shall continue until the EXHIBIT(S) have expired or have been terminated (the “{Def.Term.Target}”) unless terminated earlier by the Parties pursuant to Section 3.2.  Each EXHIBIT shall expire when all {_Services} thereunder have been performed and/or when all Deliverables have been delivered in accordance with such EXHIBIT.
 
3.2.Ti=Termination

3.2.sec=Either {_Party} may terminate this {_Agreement} or any EXHIBIT(S) for any reason at any time with {Terminate.AtWillMutual.NoticePeriod.days} written notice to the other {_Party} (the “{_Notice_Period}”).  If either {_Party} terminates this {_Agreement} or any EXHIBIT(S) at any time, {_Service_Provider} will only be obligated to continue to provide the {_Client} with the {_Services} or continued work on the Deliverables up to the end of the {_Notice_Period} as long as the {_Client} is not in default under this {_Agreement}.
 
3.3.Ti=Effect of Termination

3.3.sec=In the event this {_Agreement} or any EXHIBIT is terminated for any reason, (i) {_Service_Provider}’s obligation to provide {_Services} shall cease, and (ii) {_Client} shall pay {_Service_Provider} all {_Compensation} and Expenses incurred prior to the effective date of such expiration or termination.

7.2.Ti={_Service_Provider_Materials}; License

7.2.sec=Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, {_Service_Provider} retains all right, title and interest in any and all methods, materials, technologies, tools (including software tools), design code, templates, applications, techniques and other know-how developed by or for {_Service_Provider}:  (i) prior to and/or independent of the {_Services} provided hereunder, and/or (ii) relating to {_Service_Provider}’s innovation and design processes used to perform the {_Services} or create the Deliverables, including ideas, designs, sketches, drawings and other intellectual property in and to any proposals for any Deliverables by {_Service_Provider} that are not selected by {_Client} for the final Deliverables.

To the extent any {_Third-Party_Assets} are included in the final Deliverables, unless otherwise provided in any EXHIBIT, {_Client} will be responsible for all license fees and royalties relating to such use of the {_Third-Party_Assets}.
