ConsequentialDamages.1.sec=In no event will <a class='definedterm' href='#Def.Vendor.sec'>Vendor</a> be liable to <a class='definedterm' href='#Def.Customer.sec'>Customer</a> for any consequential, indirect, special, incidental, or punitive damages arising out of or related to this <a class='definedterm' href='#Def.Agreement.sec'>Agreement</a>.

[FootNote A10]=Many customers insist on mutual limits of liability. In those cases, the vendor should consider excluding IP infringement and possibly other claims from the limit.

ConsequentialDamages.2.sec=The liabilities limited by this Article {Xnum} apply: (a) to liability for negligence; (b) regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort, strict product liability, or otherwise; (c) even if <a class='definedterm' href='#Def.Vendor.sec'>Vendor</a> is advised in advance of the possibility of the damages in question and even if such damages were foreseeable; and (d) even if <a class='definedterm' href='#Def.Customer.sec'>Customer</a>’s remedies fail of their essential purpose.

ConsequentialDamages.3.sec=If applicable law limits the application of the provisions of this Article {Xnum}, <a class='definedterm' href='#Def.Vendor.sec'>Vendor</a>’s liability will be limited to the maximum extent permissible. For the avoidance of doubt, <a class='definedterm' href='#Def.Vendor.sec'>Vendor</a>’s liability limits and other rights set forth in this Article {Xnum} apply likewise to <a class='definedterm' href='#Def.Vendor.sec'>Vendor</a>’s affiliates, licensors, suppliers, advertisers, agents, sponsors, directors, officers, employees, consultants, and other representatives.
