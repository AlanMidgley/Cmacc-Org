Note=from [?https://TechContracts.com/]  The introductory materials are visible by looking at the source of this page via the link to "GitHub" above.

Note=This is a first, simple prose objectification of the license agreement.  It breaks each section and subsection into a separate unit (key/value) and reassembles them into the whole document.  It has a few alternatives, done with the /Alt/ widget.  Only one section, ConfInfo (Confidential Information) is broken out into a separate file and referenced for transclusion.  The original footnotes are now directly next to the text. 

Note=The semantic naming of sections only goes to the section level, not to subsections and beyond, which remain with their original number references.  Cross-references and defined terms have not yet been parameterized and made into links to the referenced section or definition.  In short, this document has only begun to be automated.

[FootNote A7]=You could instead warrant that each <a class="definedterm" href='#Def.Deliverable.sec'>Deliverable</a> will function according to its <a class="definedterm" href='#Def.Specifications.sec'>Specifications</a>, and possibly separately warrant that the <a class="definedterm" href='#Def.Software.sec'>Software</a> as initially delivered will perform according to its <a class="definedterm" href='#Def.Specifications.sec'>Specifications</a>. (See the definition of "<a class="definedterm" href='#Def.Specifications.sec'>Specifications</a>" in Article 1.) The result would be multiple warranties.

Warrant.1.2.Ti=Re Viruses

In the event of a breach of the warranty in this Subsection {Warrant.Xnum}.1(c), <a class="definedterm" href='#Def.Vendor.sec'>Vendor</a>, at its own expense, shall promptly take the following actions: (i) secure for <a class="definedterm" href='#Def.Customer.sec'>Customer</a> the right to continue using the <a class="definedterm" href='#Def.Software.sec'>Software</a>; (ii) replace or modify the <a class="definedterm" href='#Def.Software.sec'>Software</a> to make it noninfringing, provided such modification or replacement will not materially degrade any functionality listed in the <a class="definedterm" href='#Def.Specifications.sec'>Specifications</a>; or (iii) refund {Warranty.SoftwareInfringement.Refund.%} of the licensee fee paid for the <a class="definedterm" href='#Def.Software.sec'>Software</a> for every month remaining in the <a class="definedterm" href='#Def.License_Term.sec'>License Term</a>, in which case <a class="definedterm" href='#Def.Vendor.sec'>Vendor</a> may terminate any or all <a class="definedterm" href='#Def.Customer.sec'>Customer</a> licenses to the <a class="definedterm" href='#Def.Software.sec'>Software</a> granted in this <a class="definedterm" href='#Def.Agreement.sec'>Agreement</a> and require return or destruction of copies thereof.

Indemnitor will control the defense of any Indemnified Claim, including appeals, negotiations, and any settlement or compromise thereof; provided Indemnified Party will have the right, not to be exercised unreasonably, to reject any settlement or compromise that requires that it admit wrongdoing or liability or subjects it to any ongoing affirmative obligations.

[FootNote A10]=Many customers insist on mutual limits of liability. In those cases, the vendor should consider excluding IP infringement and possibly other claims from the limit.

LimitLiability.2.2.sec=The liabilities limited by this Article {LimitLiability.Xnum} apply: (a) to liability for negligence; (b) regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort, strict product liability, or otherwise; (c) even if <a class="definedterm" href='#Def.Vendor.sec'>Vendor</a> is advised in advance of the possibility of the damages in question and even if such damages were foreseeable; and (d) even if <a class="definedterm" href='#Def.Customer.sec'>Customer</a>’s remedies fail of their essential purpose.

LimitLiability.2.3.sec=If applicable law limits the application of the provisions of this Article {LimitLiability.Xnum}, <a class="definedterm" href='#Def.Vendor.sec'>Vendor</a>’s liability will be limited to the maximum extent permissible. For the avoidance of doubt, <a class="definedterm" href='#Def.Vendor.sec'>Vendor</a>’s liability limits and other rights set forth in this Article {LimitLiability.Xnum} apply likewise to <a class="definedterm" href='#Def.Vendor.sec'>Vendor</a>’s affiliates, licensors, suppliers, advertisers, agents, sponsors, directors, officers, employees, consultants, and other representatives.
