3.2.1.sec=Each Deliverable, and the Software itself upon incorporation of the final Deliverable, will be considered accepted (“Acceptance”) (i) when Customer provides Vendor written notice of acceptance or (ii) {Acceptance.MaxPeriodForResponse.Days} after delivery, if Customer has not first provided Vendor with written notice of rejection. Customer may reject a Deliverable or the final Software only in the event that it materially deviates from its Specifications and only via written notice setting forth the nature of such deviation. In the event of such rejection, Vendor shall correct the deviation and redeliver the Deliverable or final Software within {RedeliverWithIn.Days}. After redelivery pursuant to the previous sentence, the parties shall again follow the acceptance procedures set forth in this Subsection 3.2(a).

3.2.2.Ti=Incorporation of Deliverables

3.2.2.sec=Upon Acceptance, each Deliverable will constitute an element of the Software and will thereafter be subject to this Agreement’s terms regarding the Software, including without limitation license, warranty, and indemnity terms.

(“Consumer Price Index” refers to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, All U.S. Cities Average, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor, or such successor index, appropriately converted to an equivalent reference base, as will be published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.) No new License Term or Maintenance Term will go into effect before payment of the applicable License Fees or Maintenance Fees.

5.=[G/Z/ol/3]

6.Ti=IP & FEEDBACK

6.1.Ti=IP Rights in the Software

6.1.sec=Vendor retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Documentation and Software, including without limitation Deliverables and Upgrades, except to the extent of the limited licenses specifically set forth in Section 2.1 (Licenses), the last sentence of Section 2.4 (Documentation) above, and Section 9.3 (Escrow License) below. Customer recognizes that the Software and its components are protected by copyright and other laws.

6.2.Ti=Feedback

6.2.sec=Vendor has not agreed to and does not agree to treat as confidential any Feedback (as defined below) that Customer or Users provide to Vendor, and nothing in this Agreement or in the parties’ dealings arising out of or related to this Agreement will restrict Vendor’s right to use, profit from, disclose, publish, keep secret, or otherwise exploit Feedback, without compensating or crediting Customer or the User in question. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 7 (Confidential Information) below, Feedback will not be considered Customer’s Confidential Information. (“Feedback” refers to any suggestion or idea for improving or otherwise modifying any of Vendor’s products or services.)

6.=[G/Z/ol/2]

7.Ti=CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

[FootNote A4]=This can be easily transformed into a one-way confidentiality/NDA clause.

7.1.Ti=Confidential Information Defined

7.1.sec=“Confidential Information” refers to the following one party to this Agreement (“Discloser”) discloses to the other (“Recipient”): (a) any document Discloser marks “Confidential”; (b) any information Discloser orally designates as “Confidential” at the time of disclosure, provided Discloser confirms such designation in writing within {ConfInfo.ConfirmInWriting.Period}; (c) any source code disclosed by Vendor and any names of actual or potential customers disclosed by Customer, whether or not marked as confidential; and (d) any other nonpublic, sensitive information Recipient should reasonably consider a trade secret or otherwise confidential. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information does not include information that: (i) is in Recipient’s possession at the time of disclosure; (ii) is independently developed by Recipient without use of or reference to Confidential Information; (iii) becomes known publicly, before or after disclosure, other than as a result of Recipient’s improper action or inaction; or (iv) is approved for release in writing by Discloser. Recipient is on notice that Confidential Information may include Discloser’s valuable trade secrets.

7.2.Ti=Nondisclosure

7.2.sec=Recipient shall not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than to facilitate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the “Purpose”). Recipient: (a) shall not disclose Confidential Information to any employee or contractor of Recipient unless such person needs access in order to facilitate the Purpose and executes a nondisclosure agreement with Recipient with terms no less restrictive than those of this Article 7; and (b) shall not disclose Confidential Information to any other third party without Discloser’s prior written consent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Recipient shall protect Confidential Information with the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information of similar nature and importance, but with no less than reasonable care. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Recipient may disclose Confidential Information as required by applicable law or by proper legal or governmental authority. Recipient shall give Discloser prompt notice of any such legal or governmental demand and reasonably cooperate with Discloser in any effort to seek a protective order or otherwise to contest such required disclosure, at Discloser’s expense. Recipient shall promptly notify Discloser of any misuse or misappropriation of Confidential Information that comes to Recipient’s attention.

7.3.Ti=Injunction

7.3.sec=Recipient agrees that breach of this Article 7 would cause Discloser irreparable injury, for which monetary damages would not provide adequate compensation, and that in addition to any other remedy, Discloser shall be entitled to injunctive relief against such breach or threatened breach, without proving actual damage or posting a bond or other security.

7.4.Ti=Termination & Return

7.4.sec=With respect to each item of Confidential Information, the obligations of Section 7.2 above (Nondisclosure) will terminate {Conf.Life.Period} after the date of disclosure; provided that such obligations related to Confidential Information constituting Discloser’s trade secrets will continue so long as such information remains subject to trade secret protection pursuant to applicable law. Upon termination of this Agreement, Recipient shall return all copies of Confidential Information to Discloser or certify, in writing, the destruction thereof.

7.5.Ti=Retention of Rights

7.5.sec=This Agreement does not transfer ownership of Confidential Information or grant a license thereto. Discloser will retain all right, title, and interest in and to all Confidential Information.

7.6.Ti=Exception & Immunity

7.6.0.sec=Pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, 18 USC Section 1833(b), Recipient is on notice and acknowledges that, notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement:

7.6.1.Ti=IMMUNITY

7.6.1.sec=An individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that- (A) is made- (i) in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal.

7.6.2.Ti=USE OF TRADE SECRET INFORMATION IN ANTI-RETALIATION LAWSUIT

7.6.2.sec=An individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual- (A) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and (B) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.

7.6.=[G/Z/ol-a/2]

7.=[G/Z/ol/6]

8.Ti=SOFTWARE AUDIT

8.sec=During the Term of this Agreement and at any time during the {SoftwareAudit.ContinuingAfterTerm.Period} thereafter, Vendor may audit Customer’s use of Software on {SoftwareAudit.Notice.Days}’ advance written notice. Customer shall cooperate with the audit, including by providing access to any books, computers, records, or other information that relate or may relate to use of Software. Such audit will not unreasonably interfere with Customer’s business activities. If Vendor discovers unauthorized use, reproduction, distribution, or other exploitation of Software, in excess of {SoftwareAudit.CostShiftedOnShortfallOf.%} of the copies or fees that would have applied to authorized exploitation, Customer shall reimburse Vendor for the reasonable cost of the audit, or of the next audit in case of discovery without an audit, in addition to such other rights and remedies as Vendor may have. Vendor may not conduct an audit more than once per year. Customer’s books and records disclosed pursuant to an audit will be considered Customer’s Confidential Information pursuant to Article 7 above unless Customer informs Vendor to the contrary in writing.

9.Ti=SOURCE CODE ESCROW.

9.1.Ti=Escrow Agreement

9.1.sec=Concurrent with execution of this Agreement, the parties shall execute a third party escrow agreement in the form attached hereto as Attachment B (the “Escrow Agreement”), in conjunction with {SoftwareEscrow.Agent.US.N,E,A} (the “Escrow Agent”).

9.2.Ti=Deposit & Verification.

9.2.1.Ti=Deposit

9.2.1.1.sec=Within {SoftwareEscrow.DepositWithin.Period} of the Effective Date, Vendor shall deposit with the Escrow Agent, pursuant to the procedures of the Escrow Agreement, the source code for the Software, as well as the Documentation and names and contact information for each author or other creator of the Software.

[FootNote A6]=This is particularly customer-friendly.

9.2.1.2.sec=Promptly after Acceptance of any Deliverable or delivery of any Upgrade, Vendor shall deposit updated source code, Documentation, names, and contact information with the Escrow Agent. (“Deposit Material” refers to material required to be deposited pursuant to this Subsection 9.2(a).).

9.2.1.=[G/Z/para/s2]

9.2.2.Ti=Verification

9.2.2.sec=At Customer’s request and expense, the Escrow Agent may at any time verify the Deposit Material, including without limitation by compiling source code, comparing it to the Software, and reviewing the completeness and accuracy of any and all material. In the event that the Deposit Material does not conform to the requirements of Subsection 9.2(a) above: (i) Vendor shall promptly deposit conforming Deposit Material; and (ii) Vendor shall pay the Escrow Agent for subsequent verification of the new Deposit Material. Any breach of the provisions of Subsection 9.2(b)(i) above will constitute material breach of this Agreement, and no further payments will be due from Customer until such breach is cured, in addition to such other remedies as Customer may have.

9.2.=[G/Z/ol-a/2]

9.3.Ti=Escrow License

9.3.sec=Vendor hereby grants Customer a license to use, reproduce, and create derivative works from the Deposit Material, provided Customer may not distribute or sublicense the Deposit Material or make any use of it whatsoever except for such internal use as is necessary to maintain and support the Software. Copies of the Deposit Material created or transferred pursuant to this Agreement are licensed, not sold, and Customer receives no title to or ownership of any copy or of the Deposit Material itself. The Deposit Material constitutes Confidential Information of Vendor pursuant to Article 7 (Confidential Information) above (provided no provision of Article 7 calling for return of Confidential Information before termination of this Agreement or of the applicable License Term will apply to the Deposit Material).

9.4.Ti=Escrow Release Conditions

9.4.sec=The term “Release Conditions,” as used in the Escrow Agreement, refers to any of the following: (a) material breach by Vendor of Section 4.1 (Provision of Maintenance) above, if such breach remains uncured {SoftwareEscrow.Cure.Period} or more business days after Customer’s written notice; (b) any failure of Vendor to function as a going concern; (c) appointment, application for, or consent to a receiver, trustee, or other custodian for Vendor or its assets; (d) Vendor becomes insolvent or unable to pay its debts as they mature in the ordinary course or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; (e) Vendor is liquidated or dissolved; or (f) any proceedings are commenced with regard to Vendor under any bankruptcy, insolvency, or debtor’s relief law, and such proceedings are not dismissed within 60 days.

9.=[G/Z/ol/4]

10.Ti=REPRESENTATIONS & WARRANTIES

10.1.Ti=From Vendor

10.1.1.Ti=Re Function

10.1.1.sec=Vendor represents and warrants that, during the {Warranty.SoftwarePerformance.Period} following Go-Live, the Software will perform materially as described in its Specifications.

[FootNote A7]=You could instead warrant that each Deliverable will function according to its Specifications, and possibly separately warrant that the Software as initially delivered will perform according to its Specifications. (See the definition of "Specifications" in Article 1.) The result would be multiple warranties.

10.1.2.Ti=Re Viruses

10.1.2.sec=Vendor represents and warrants that the Software and any media used to distribute it contain no viruses or other computer instructions or technological means intended to disrupt, damage, or interfere with the use of computers or related systems.

[FootNote A8]=This is relatively customer-friendly.


10.1.3.Ti=Re IP Rights in the Software.

10.1.3.sec=Subject to the next sentence, Vendor represents and warrants that it is the owner of the Software and of each and every component thereof, or the recipient of a valid license thereto, and that it has and will maintain the full power and authority to grant the rights granted in this Agreement without the further consent of any third party. Vendor’s representations and warranties in the preceding sentence do not apply to the extent that the infringement arises out of any of the conditions listed in Subsection 11.1(a) below. In the event of a breach of the warranty in this Subsection 10.1(c), Vendor, at its own expense, shall promptly take the following actions: (i) secure for Customer the right to continue using the Software; (ii) replace or modify the Software to make it noninfringing, provided such modification or replacement will not materially degrade any functionality listed in the Specifications; or (iii) refund {Warranty.SoftwareInfringement.Refund.%} of the licensee fee paid for the Software for every month remaining in the License Term, in which case Vendor may terminate any or all Customer licenses to the Software granted in this Agreement and require return or destruction of copies thereof. In conjunction with Customer’s right to terminate for breach where applicable and the provisions of Section 11.1 below (Indemnification From Vendor), the preceding sentence states Vendor’s sole obligation and liability, and Customer’s sole remedy, for breach of the warranty in this Subsection 10.1(c) and for potential or actual intellectual property infringement by the Software.

10.1.4.Ti=Re Customization Services

10.1.4.sec=Vendor represents and warrants that all Customization Services will be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner.

10.1.=[G/Z/ol-a/4]

10.2.Ti=From Both Parties

10.2.sec=Each party represents and warrants that it has the full right and authority to enter into, execute, and perform its obligations under this Agreement and that no pending or threatened claim or litigation known to it would have a material adverse impact on its ability to perform as required by this Agreement.

10.3.Ti=Warranty Disclaimers

10.3.sec=Except for the express warranties in Section 10.1 above, <span style="text-transform:uppercase">Vendor makes no warranties, either express or implied, including without limitation any implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or noninfringement of intellectual property rights or any implied warranty arising from statute, course of dealing, course of performance, or usage of trade.</span> Vendor does not warrant that the Software will perform without error or that it will run without immaterial interruption. Vendor provides no warranty regarding, and will have no responsibility for, any claim arising out of: (a) a modification of the Software made by anyone other than Vendor, unless Vendor approves such modification in writing; or (b) use of the Software in combination with any operating system not authorized in the Specifications or Documentation or with hardware or software specifically forbidden by the Specifications or Documentation.

10.=[G/Z/ol/3]

11.Ti=INDEMNIFICATION

11.1.Ti=From Vendor

11.1.sec=Vendor shall defend and indemnify Customer and Customer’s Associates (as defined below in Section 11.3) against any “Indemnified Claim,” meaning any third party claim, suit, or proceeding arising out of, related to, or alleging infringement of any patent, copyright, trade secret, or other intellectual property right by the Software.

11.1.1.Ti=Exceptions to IP Indemnity

11.1.1.sec=Vendor’s obligations set forth in this Section 11.1 do not apply to the extent that an Indemnified Claim arises out of: (i) Customer’s breach of this Agreement; (ii) revisions to the Software made without Vendor’s written consent; (iii) Customer’s failure to incorporate Upgrades that would have avoided the alleged infringement, provided Vendor offered such Upgrades without charges not otherwise required pursuant to this Agreement; (iv) Vendor’s modification of Software in compliance with specifications provided by Customer, including without limitation Deliverables to the extent created based on such specifications, provided the exception in this Subsection 11.1(a)(iv) does not apply if the alleged infringement results from the Vendor’s method of implementing Customer’s specifications, rather than as an inevitable result of implementing such specifications; or (v) use of the Software in combination with hardware or software not provided by Vendor, unless the Documentation or Specifications refers to a combination with such hardware or software (without directing the user not to perform such a combination).

[FootNote A9]=This is a customer-friendly qualification (though not the most customer-friendly version in Chapter II.J.3 of The Tech Contracts Handbook).

11.1.2.Ti=Response to Claims

11.1.2.sec=In the event of an Indemnified Claim, Vendor may exercise any of the rights set forth in Subsections 10.1(c)(i) through 10.1(c)(iii) above, including without limitation its right therein to terminate licenses and require return of the Software.

11.1.=[G/Z/ol-a/2]

11.2.Ti=From Customer

11.2.sec=Customer shall indemnify and defend Vendor and Vendor’s Associates (as defined below in Section 11.3) against any “Indemnified Claim,” meaning any third party claim, suit, or proceeding arising out of, related to, or alleging: (a) the injury to or death of any individual, or any loss of or damage to real or tangible personal property, caused by the act or omission of Customer or of any of its agents, subcontractors, or employees; or (b) any of the acts or events described in Subsection 11.1(a)(i) through 11.1(a)(v) above.

11.3.Ti=Litigation & Additional Terms

11.3.sec=The obligations of the indemnifying party (“Indemnitor”) pursuant to Section 11.1 or 11.2 above: (a) include retention and payment of attorneys and payment of court costs, as well as settlement at Indemnitor’s expense and payment of judgments; and (b) will be excused to the extent that the other contracting party’s (“Indemnified Party’s”) or any of such Indemnified Party’s Associates’ failure to provide prompt notice of the Indemnified Claim or reasonably to cooperate materially prejudices the defense. Indemnitor will control the defense of any Indemnified Claim, including appeals, negotiations, and any settlement or compromise thereof; provided Indemnified Party will have the right, not to be exercised unreasonably, to reject any settlement or compromise that requires that it admit wrongdoing or liability or subjects it to any ongoing affirmative obligations. (As used in this Article 11, a party’s “Associates” are its officers, directors, shareholders, parents, subsidiaries, agents, successors, and assigns.)

11.=[G/Z/ol/3] 

12.Ti=LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

12.1.Ti=Dollar Cap

12.1.sec=Vendor’s liability arising out of or related to this Agreement will not exceed {LimitVendorLiability.Max.$}.

12.2.Ti=Exclusion of Consequential Damages

12.2.1.sec=In no event will Vendor be liable to Customer for any consequential, indirect, special, incidental, or punitive damages arising out of or related to this Agreement.

[FootNote A10]=Many customers insist on mutual limits of liability. In those cases, the vendor should consider excluding IP infringement and possibly other claims from the limit.

12.2.2.sec=The liabilities limited by this Article 12 apply: (a) to liability for negligence; (b) regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort, strict product liability, or otherwise; (c) even if Vendor is advised in advance of the possibility of the damages in question and even if such damages were foreseeable; and (d) even if Customer’s remedies fail of their essential purpose.

12.2.3.sec=If applicable law limits the application of the provisions of this Article 12, Vendor’s liability will be limited to the maximum extent permissible. For the avoidance of doubt, Vendor’s liability limits and other rights set forth in this Article 12 apply likewise to Vendor’s affiliates, licensors, suppliers, advertisers, agents, sponsors, directors, officers, employees, consultants, and other representatives.

12.2.sec=<span style="text-transform:uppercase">{12.2.1.sec}</span> <span style="text-transform:uppercase">{12.2.2.sec}</span>{12.2.3.sec}

12.3.Ti=Exceptions to Limitation of Liability

12.3.sec=Sections 12.1 (Dollar Cap) and 12.2 (Exclusion of Consequential Damages) above do not apply to: (a) breach of Section 7.2 (Nondisclosure) above; (b) obligations and liabilities pursuant to Article 11 above (Indemnification); or (c) claims for attorneys’ fees and other litigation costs recoverable by the prevailing party in any action.
