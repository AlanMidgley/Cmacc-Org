Note=This is a first, simple prose objectification of the license agreement.  It breaks each section and subsection into a separate unit (key/value) and reassembles them into the whole document.  It has a few alternatives, done with the /Alt/ widget.  Only one section, ConfInfo (Confidential Information) is broken out into a separate file and referenced for transclusion.  The original footnotes are now directly next to the text. 

Note=The semantic naming of sections only goes to the section level, not to subsections and beyond, which remain with their original number references.  Cross-references and defined terms have not yet been parameterized and made into links to the referenced section or definition.  In short, this document has only begun to be automated.

In the event that the Deposit Material does not conform to the requirements of Subsection {SourceCodeEscrow.Xnum}.2(a) above: (i) Vendor shall promptly deposit conforming Deposit Material; and (ii) Vendor shall pay the Escrow Agent for subsequent verification of the new Deposit Material. Any breach of the provisions of Subsection {SourceCodeEscrow.Xnum}.2(b)(i) above will constitute material breach of this Agreement, and no further payments will be due from Customer until such breach is cured, in addition to such other remedies as Customer may have.

SourceCodeEscrow.2.=[G/Z/ol-a/2]

SourceCodeEscrow.3.Ti=Escrow License

SourceCodeEscrow.3.sec=Vendor hereby grants Customer a license to use, reproduce, and create derivative works from the Deposit Material, provided Customer may not distribute or sublicense the Deposit Material or make any use of it whatsoever except for such internal use as is necessary to maintain and support the Software.

Warrant.1.Ti=From Vendor

Warrant.1.1.Ti=Re Function

Warrant.1.1.sec=Vendor represents and warrants that, during the {Warranty.SoftwarePerformance.Period} following Go-Live, the Software will perform materially as described in its Specifications.

[FootNote A7]=You could instead warrant that each Deliverable will function according to its Specifications, and possibly separately warrant that the Software as initially delivered will perform according to its Specifications. (See the definition of "Specifications" in Article 1.) The result would be multiple warranties.

Warrant.1.2.Ti=Re Viruses

Warrant.1.2.sec=Vendor represents and warrants that the Software and any media used to distribute it contain no viruses or other computer instructions or technological means intended to disrupt, damage, or interfere with the use of computers or related systems.

[FootNote A8]=This is relatively customer-friendly.

Warrant.1.3.Ti=Re IP Rights in the Software.

Warrant.1.3.sec=Subject to the next sentence, Vendor represents and warrants that it is the owner of the Software and of each and every component thereof, or the recipient of a valid license thereto, and that it has and will maintain the full power and authority to grant the rights granted in this Agreement without the further consent of any third party. Vendor’s representations and warranties in the preceding sentence do not apply to the extent that the infringement arises out of any of the conditions listed in Subsection {Def.Xnum}1.1(a) below. In the event of a breach of the warranty in this Subsection {Warrant.Xnum}.1(c), Vendor, at its own expense, shall promptly take the following actions: (i) secure for Customer the right to continue using the Software; (ii) replace or modify the Software to make it noninfringing, provided such modification or replacement will not materially degrade any functionality listed in the Specifications; or (iii) refund {Warranty.SoftwareInfringement.Refund.%} of the licensee fee paid for the Software for every month remaining in the License Term, in which case Vendor may terminate any or all Customer licenses to the Software granted in this Agreement and require return or destruction of copies thereof. In conjunction with Customer’s right to terminate for breach where applicable and the provisions of Section {Indemnify.Xnum}.1 below (Indemnification From Vendor), the preceding sentence states Vendor’s sole obligation and liability, and Customer’s sole remedy, for breach of the warranty in this Subsection {Warrant.Xnum}.1(c) and for potential or actual intellectual property infringement by the Software.

Warrant.1.4.Ti=Re Customization Services

Warrant.1.4.sec=Vendor represents and warrants that all Customization Services will be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner.

Warrant.1.=[G/Z/ol-a/4]

Warrant.2.Ti=From Both Parties

Warrant.2.sec=Each party represents and warrants that it has the full right and authority to enter into, execute, and perform its obligations under this Agreement and that no pending or threatened claim or litigation known to it would have a material adverse impact on its ability to perform as required by this Agreement.

Warrant.3.Ti=Warranty Disclaimers

Warrant.3.sec=Except for the express warranties in Section {Warrant.Xnum}.1 above, <span style="text-transform:uppercase">Vendor makes no warranties, either express or implied, including without limitation any implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or noninfringement of intellectual property rights or any implied warranty arising from statute, course of dealing, course of performance, or usage of trade.</span> Vendor does not warrant that the Software will perform without error or that it will run without immaterial interruption. Vendor provides no warranty regarding, and will have no responsibility for, any claim arising out of: (a) a modification of the Software made by anyone other than Vendor, unless Vendor approves such modification in writing; or (b) use of the Software in combination with any operating system not authorized in the Specifications or Documentation or with hardware or software specifically forbidden by the Specifications or Documentation.

Warrant.=[G/Z/ol/3]

Indemnify.Ti=INDEMNIFICATION

Indemnify.1.Ti=From Vendor

Indemnify.1.sec=Vendor shall defend and indemnify Customer and Customer’s Associates (as defined below in Section {Indemnify.Xnum}.3) against any “Indemnified Claim,” meaning any third party claim, suit, or proceeding arising out of, related to, or alleging infringement of any patent, copyright, trade secret, or other intellectual property right by the Software.

Indemnify.1.1.Ti=Exceptions to IP Indemnity

Indemnify.1.1.sec=Vendor’s obligations set forth in this Section {Indemnify.Xnum}.1 do not apply to the extent that an Indemnified Claim arises out of: (i) Customer’s breach of this Agreement; (ii) revisions to the Software made without Vendor’s written consent; (iii) Customer’s failure to incorporate Upgrades that would have avoided the alleged infringement, provided Vendor offered such Upgrades without charges not otherwise required pursuant to this Agreement; (iv) Vendor’s modification of Software in compliance with specifications provided by Customer, including without limitation Deliverables to the extent created based on such specifications, provided the exception in this Subsection {Indemnify.Xnum}.1(a)(iv) does not apply if the alleged infringement results from the Vendor’s method of implementing Customer’s specifications, rather than as an inevitable result of implementing such specifications; or (v) use of the Software in combination with hardware or software not provided by Vendor, unless the Documentation or Specifications refers to a combination with such hardware or software (without directing the user not to perform such a combination).

[FootNote A9]=This is a customer-friendly qualification (though not the most customer-friendly version in Chapter II.J.3 of The Tech Contracts Handbook).

Indemnify.1.2.Ti=Response to Claims

Indemnify.1.2.sec=In the event of an Indemnified Claim, Vendor may exercise any of the rights set forth in Subsections {Warrant.Xnum}.1(c)(i) through {Warrant.Xnum}.1(c)(iii) above, including without limitation its right therein to terminate licenses and require return of the Software.

Indemnify.1.=[G/Z/ol-a/2]

Indemnify.2.Ti=From Customer

Indemnify.2.sec=Customer shall indemnify and defend Vendor and Vendor’s Associates (as defined below in Section {Indemnify.Xnum}.3) against any “Indemnified Claim,” meaning any third party claim, suit, or proceeding arising out of, related to, or alleging: (a) the injury to or death of any individual, or any loss of or damage to real or tangible personal property, caused by the act or omission of Customer or of any of its agents, subcontractors, or employees; or (b) any of the acts or events described in Subsection {Indemnify.Xnum}.1(a)(i) through {Indemnify.Xnum}.1(a)(v) above.

Indemnify.3.Ti=Litigation & Additional Terms

Indemnify.3.sec=The obligations of the indemnifying party (“Indemnitor”) pursuant to Section {Indemnify.Xnum}.1 or {Indemnify.Xnum}.2 above: (a) include retention and payment of attorneys and payment of court costs, as well as settlement at Indemnitor’s expense and payment of judgments; and (b) will be excused to the extent that the other contracting party’s (“Indemnified Party’s”) or any of such Indemnified Party’s Associates’ failure to provide prompt notice of the Indemnified Claim or reasonably to cooperate materially prejudices the defense. Indemnitor will control the defense of any Indemnified Claim, including appeals, negotiations, and any settlement or compromise thereof; provided Indemnified Party will have the right, not to be exercised unreasonably, to reject any settlement or compromise that requires that it admit wrongdoing or liability or subjects it to any ongoing affirmative obligations. (As used in this Article {Indemnify.Xnum}, a party’s “Associates” are its officers, directors, shareholders, parents, subsidiaries, agents, successors, and assigns.)

Indemnify.=[G/Z/ol/3]

LimitLiability.1.Ti=Dollar Cap

LimitLiability.1.sec=Vendor’s liability arising out of or related to this Agreement will not exceed {LimitVendorLiability.Max.$}.

LimitLiability.2.Ti=Exclusion of Consequential Damages

LimitLiability.2.1.sec=In no event will Vendor be liable to Customer for any consequential, indirect, special, incidental, or punitive damages arising out of or related to this Agreement.

[FootNote A10]=Many customers insist on mutual limits of liability. In those cases, the vendor should consider excluding IP infringement and possibly other claims from the limit.

LimitLiability.2.2.sec=The liabilities limited by this Article {LimitLiability.Xnum} apply: (a) to liability for negligence; (b) regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort, strict product liability, or otherwise; (c) even if Vendor is advised in advance of the possibility of the damages in question and even if such damages were foreseeable; and (d) even if Customer’s remedies fail of their essential purpose.

LimitLiability.2.3.sec=If applicable law limits the application of the provisions of this Article {LimitLiability.Xnum}, Vendor’s liability will be limited to the maximum extent permissible. For the avoidance of doubt, Vendor’s liability limits and other rights set forth in this Article {LimitLiability.Xnum} apply likewise to Vendor’s affiliates, licensors, suppliers, advertisers, agents, sponsors, directors, officers, employees, consultants, and other representatives.

LimitLiability.2.sec=<span style="text-transform:uppercase">{LimitLiability.2.1.sec}</span> <span style="text-transform:uppercase">{LimitLiability.2.2.sec}</span>{LimitLiability.2.3.sec}

LimitLiability.3.Ti=Exceptions to Limitation of Liability

LimitLiability.3.sec=Sections {LimitLiability.Xnum}.1 (Dollar Cap) and {LimitLiability.Xnum}.2 (Exclusion of Consequential Damages) above do not apply to: (a) breach of Section {ConfInfo.Xnum}.2 (Nondisclosure) above; (b) obligations and liabilities pursuant to Article {Indemnify.Xnum} above (Indemnification); or (c) claims for attorneys’ fees and other litigation costs recoverable by the prevailing party in any action.
