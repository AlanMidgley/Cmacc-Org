sec=<ol><li>{ByVendor.Sec}<li>{Mutual.Sec}<li>{Limit.Sec}</ol>

ByVendor.Ti=From Vendor

ByVendor.SoftwareFunction.Ti=Re Function

ByVendor.SoftwareFunction.sec=<a class='definedterm' href='#Def.Vendor.sec'>Vendor</a> represents and warrants that, during the {Warranty.SoftwarePerformance.Period} following <a class='definedterm' href='#Def.Go-Live.sec'>Go-Live</a>, the <a class='definedterm' href='#Def.Software.sec'>Software</a> will perform materially as described in its <a class='definedterm' href='#Def.Specifications.sec'>Specifications</a>.

ByVendor.SoftwareFunction.=[G/Z/ol/Base]

[FootNote A7]=You could instead warrant that each <a class='definedterm' href='#Def.Deliverable.sec'>Deliverable</a> will function according to its <a class='definedterm' href='#Def.Specifications.sec'>Specifications</a>, and possibly separately warrant that the <a class='definedterm' href='#Def.Software.sec'>Software</a> as initially delivered will perform according to its <a class='definedterm' href='#Def.Specifications.sec'>Specifications</a>. (See the definition of "<a class='definedterm' href='#Def.Specifications.sec'>Specifications</a>" in Article 1.) The result would be multiple warranties.

ByVendor.SoftwareVirus.Ti=Re Viruses

ByVendor.SoftwareVirus.sec=<a class='definedterm' href='#Def.Vendor.sec'>Vendor</a> represents and warrants that the <a class='definedterm' href='#Def.Software.sec'>Software</a> and any media used to distribute it contain no viruses or other computer instructions or technological means intended to disrupt, damage, or interfere with the use of computers or related systems.
