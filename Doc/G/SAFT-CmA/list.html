This is a Prose Object fork of <a href="https://github.com/saft-project/saft">https://github.com/saft-project/saft</a>.  It retains all of the substanceof the original Word document except for the footnotes.<br>There are stubs for each of the country-specific versions suggested by the form - CA/CN/UK/US.  So far the differences are purely as suggested - a change in the securities laws warnings in the Heading.  There are obviously more changes that need to be made based on the jurisdiction, for instance the "accredited investor" or "non-US person" language.  But this shows the idea.  See the Demo.
