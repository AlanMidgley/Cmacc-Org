This example organizes a Park by Space number.  In the Space number folder, each new tenancy is a folder, using the date on which the tenancy begins and a short name for the tenant.  In that folder for the tenancy, there is a folder for each document, starting with the rental agreement, again using the start date and short name for the agreement.<br>

There is also a folder for the Tenants.  In that folder, the tenant application can be a new folder, again starting with the date of the application.<br>

There is also a small file for information about the Park.
