Ti=Waiver

sec=The delay or failure to take action because of (a) any breach of term, covenant, or condition, contained herein; or (b) the violation of any term of this Agreement, shall not be a waiver by Lessor. Acceptance of rent, service of warnings or notices, or failure thereof, is not a waiver.  If Tenant fails to meet any of its obligations of tenancy, a delay or omission by Lessor in exercising any right or remedy will not impair any rights or remedies prospectively, nor will it be considered a waiver. No waiver of owner’s right to enforce any provision of this Agreement after any default will be unless it is made in writing and signed by both parties, nor will it be considered a waiver of owner’s rights to enforce each and every provision of this Agreement upon any further or other default. Lessor may exercise any right under the terms of this Agreement or any other right, and do so after the date such right became effective, retroactivity to the effective date of the right.
