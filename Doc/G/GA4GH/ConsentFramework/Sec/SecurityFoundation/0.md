Ti=Security Foundation 

1.Ti=Risk Assessment 

1.sec=The GA4GH *Data Security Infrastructure Policy* is based on a balanced approach to risk management that relies on each individual stakeholder to help protect the security, integrity, and trustworthiness of the GA4GH ecosystem. Each stakeholder should assess its individual risk on an on-going basis and ensure that its own implemented policies, procedures, and technology protections are appropriate and sufficient for managing the identified risks not only to the enterprise, but to the GA4GH ecosystem. 

2.0.sec=To be successful, the GA4GH ecosystem needs to effectively manage the following risks. {FtNt.5.Xnum} 

2.1.sec=- Data Breach - *“a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed”* {FtNt.6.Xnum}. 

2.2.sec= - Breach of confidentiality – unauthorized disclosure of information that an individual or organization wishes to keep confidential. 

2.3.sec= - Breach of individual privacy and autonomy – access to and use of an individual’s genomic or health-related data without the appropriate knowledge or consent of the individual concerned, or for purposes the individual has not authorized. 

2.4.sec=- Malicious or accidental corruption or destruction of genomic and health-related data. 

2.5.sec=- Disruption coming from malicious/targeted acts in the availability of data and services necessary to maintain appropriate access to clinical and genomic data. 

2.6.sec=- Unethical, illegal, or inappropriate actions that attempt to breach security controls, surreptitiously obtain or derive information in an unauthorized manner, or otherwise undermine the trust fabric of the GA4GH.

2.Ti=Control Objectives 

2.1.sec=The <b>Privacy and Security Policy </b>specifically builds upon the <b>Framework’s </b>Core Element: “Privacy, Data Protection and Confidentiality”. The <b>Data Security Infrastructure Policy </b>recommends technical safeguards, standards, guidelines, and best practices for implementing and operating a technology infrastructure that will enable individual stakeholders to implement GA4GH standards safely, and to enforce the <b>Policy </b>defined for the GA4GH ecosystem. 

2.2.0.sec=Thus, the <b>Data Security Infrastructure Policy </b>is defined to meet the following six control objectives that respond to the risks identified in the above sub-section. 

2.2.1.sec=-*Control Objective 1*: Implement technology safeguards to minimize the risk of unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of confidential and private data. 

2.2.2.sec=- *Control Objective 2*: Implement technology safeguards to minimize the risk of discovery, access, and use of individuals’ clinical and genomic data, and individual identities, other than as authorized by applicable jurisdictional law, institutional policy, and individual consents. 

2.2.3.sec=- *Control Objective 3*: Implement technology safeguards to minimize the risk of accidental or malicious corruption or destruction of data. 

2.2.4.sec=- *Control Objective 4*: Implement technology safeguards to minimize the risk of disruption, degradation, and interruption of services enabling access to data. 

2.2.5.sec=- *Control Objective 5*: Implement technology safeguards to minimize the risk of potential security attacks and misuse of authorized accesses and privileges. 

2.2.6.sec=- *Control Objective 6*: Implement technology safeguards to promptly detect the failure to attain the above control objectives and to respond with proper countermeasures.

3.Ti=Guiding Principles 

3.sec=The *Data Security Infrastructure Policy* is consistent with the <a href="https://www.ga4gh.org/ga4ghtoolkit/regulatoryandethics/framework-for-responsible-sharing-genomic-and-health-related-data/">Framework for Responsible Sharing of Genomic and Health-Related Data</a>, and seeks to enforce the policy articulated in the <a href="https://www.ga4gh.org/docs/ga4ghtoolkit/data-security/Privacy-and-Security-Policy.pdf">GA4GH Privacy and Security Policy</a>*.* 

4.Ti=Data Security Stakeholders 

4.0.sec=As a virtual ecosystem, the GA4GH assigns roles and responsibilities for information security to stakeholders within this ecosystem. From a security and privacy perspective, the principal stakeholders are: 

4.1.Ti=*Operational Stakeholders*: 

4.1.1.0.sec=*Data Contributors*: the entities who make their data available for exploitation to the GA4GH ecosystem. These include: 

4.1.1.1.sec=Data subjects – people who allow their genomic and health-related data to be used and shared; 

4.1.1.2.sec=Data owners – the legal persons, agencies or bodies to which data subjects delegate the authority to decide on the access and usage of their data. 

4.1.1.=[G/Z/ol/s2]

4.1.2.sec=2. *Data Controllers*: the entities to which Data Contributors delegate the responsibility of ensuring the integrity and quality of data made available to the GA4GH community, and of guaranteeing that data management is consistent with GA4GH standards, applicable law, institutional policy, and individual permissions. 

4.1.3.0.sec=*Data Processors*: the entities who process the data provided by Data Contributors according to the business and security policies set by Data Controllers, and which put in place all the needed technical safeguards to enforce them. These include: 

4.1.3.1.sec=Infrastructure service providers - entities that provide technology resources and technical support for persisting, protecting, managing, accessing, transmitting, and using electronic data; they include both enterprise and cloud service providers; 

4.1.3.2.sec=Data service providers – entities that provide data storage, protection, management, access, and transmission services to the GA4GH community, and optionally ensure that data transmitted or uploaded to other destinations are qualified according to the specifications for both data and metadata quality, access constraints, and semantics, as appropriate; 

4.1.3.3.sec=Application service providers – entities that provide application services, such as web-based or mobile clients, for manipulating and analyzing data using GA4GH standards. 

4.1.3.=[G/Z/ol/s3]

4.1.4.sec=*Global Alliance for Genomics and Health* – a collaborative community of individuals and organizations that collectively provide foundational policy, technology standards, leadership, and sustainment to enable the ethical and productive processing and use of genomic and health-related data.

5.Ti=Data security roles and their relationships.** 

5.1.sec=The GA4GH expects that in many cases, one organization may behave in more than one operational stakeholder role. For example, a data controller may also be a data service provider; an infrastructure service provider might also offer application and data services hosted on the infrastructure they support. In such cases, the organization as a whole must demosntrate control effectiveness for the applicable controls. The expectation is that operational stakeholders should document the roles and responsibilities as appropriate within that community. Furthermore, such organization should assure that security-critical functions and responsibilities are delegated among multiple roles and multiple individuals to help avoid conflicts of interest, prevent inappropriate activities, provide broader coverage and reduce key person-risk. 

5.2.0.sec=Figure 3 below is a graphical representation of the delegation of responsibilities for implementing and operating in accordance with the GA4GH *Data Security Infrastructure Policy*.

5.2.00.sec=**Figure 3. Allocation of responsibility for security protections.** 

5.2.=[G/Z/ol-none/1]

5.3.sec=The functions listed in the vertical leftmost block are shared by all operational stakeholders, albeit in a different way for each actor (e.g data processors should notify if any breach occurs, but they are not responsible to act upon it) . Functions listed in the other blocks are allocated to data controllers, data processors, and GA4GH. 

5.4.sec=Infrastructure service providers may provide a wide range of services to data and application service providers, including computing, storage, network, and security services. Most commonly, these services will be virtualized across data centers and geographic locations. The applicability of, and responsibility for providing, each of the security functions within the “data processor” block will depend upon the specific services provided, as well as the contractual agreements established between infrastructure service providers and their customers.
