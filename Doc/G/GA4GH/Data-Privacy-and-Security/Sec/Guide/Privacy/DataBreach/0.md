Detect.sec=Mechanisms and procedures should be in place to maximize the likelihood of detection of {_data_breach}es, the handling of which may also be subject to local and national regulatory requirements.

Report.sec=A {_data_breach} involving the disclosure of {_data} by a {_data_user} should be reported to the {_data_steward} without undue delay. Consideration should be given to reporting a {_data_breach} to a competent {_supervisory_authority} and, if applicable, the {_data_protection_officer} and the relevant research ethics committee for the primary study, in addition to the {_data_steward} if no such requirement otherwise exists.

HighRisk.sec=When a {_data_breach} involving the disclosure of {_data} is likely to result in a high risk to the rights or interests of {_data_subject}s, such a breach should be reported without undue delay by the {_data_steward} or a key contact person (e.g. {_data_protection_officer}, principal investigator, communication or cohort contact officer) to {_data_subject}s in the affected database by means of a public communication or similar measure whereby the {_data_subject}s have an opportunity to be informed in an equally effective manner.
