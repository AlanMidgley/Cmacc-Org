Disclosure.sec=Assessments of {_data} privacy risks should include disclosure risks, and any harms reasonably likely to occur in the event of disclosure. These disclosures may result in individual or group discrimination, stigmatization, profiling or categorization that leads to unfair, unethical or discriminatory treatment contrary to human rights. The reputational risks for persons or organizations of allowing particular uses of {_data} should also be considered.

Safeguard.sec=Data privacy safeguards should be proportionate to the sensitivity, nature, and possible benefits, risks, and uses of the {_data}. Such safeguards may include {_controlled_access}, pseudonymization, and anonymization of {_data}, and quantitative techniques such as differential privacy, k-anonymity, â„“-diversity, and t-closeness.

Contract.sec=Data processing agreements (also known as data transfer, data use, and data sharing agreements) between persons and/or organizations are an important privacy safeguard.

CompelledDisclosure.sec=Consideration should be given to adopting mechanisms that address compelled disclosure requests by state authorities of {_identifiable_data} and that prevent unauthorized access by third parties.
