Ti=Data sustainability

1.sec=Where appropriate and in accordance with the {_data_subject}’s (or their legal representative’s) consent for {_processing}, and/or the terms and conditions of authorization for lawful {_processing} by competent bodies or institutions, and subject to appropriate safeguards, {_data} should be retained for future {_processing} through both archiving and using appropriate indexing and retrieval systems.

2.sec=A plan should be established for the possible discontinuance of a database or initiative, and in particular should establish, if possible, whether the {_data} will be archived or transferred to another database for use in future initiatives. If such archiving or transfer to another database is foreseen, the plan should make clear that {_data} will continue to be shared with {_data_user}s subject to ongoing governance oversight through e.g. a research ethics committee and/or data access committee. The lawful basis for the archiving or transferring of {_data} to another database for use in future initiative (e.g. {_data_subject} consent) should be verified.
