Ti=Interpretation

Note=The Definitions section contains a gloss on singular versus plural, that might more logically be in this Interpretation section.

1.sec=This {_policy} is intended to be flexible enough to adapt to different contexts, cultures, and countries, as well as different technologies that can impact the privacy and security of {_data}. This {_policy} also should be interpreted in a manner that acknowledges different levels of risk tolerance and community cultural practices and, where appropriate, different contexts of {_data} {_processing}.

2.sec=To encourage broad application, this {_policy} adopts the normative term “should” in most instances of the procedural guidance in section II. However, it is acknowledged that depending on the context, certain parts of the procedural guidance may be required or in contrast, be discretionary under law, regulation, or another instrument.

3.sec=This {_policy} distinguishes privacy from security. Privacy is treated as a fundamental value and right that protects all aspects of the lives of individuals, families, and communities, and that establishes reasonable limits to {_processing} {_data}. Security refers to the process of protecting {_data} from unauthorized access, use, change, disclosure, and destruction. It also includes the protection from data corruption throughout its lifecycle by considering appropriate network security, physical security, and file security. While the privacy and security aspects of this {_policy} might be addressed to different persons and organizations with diverse responsibilities, this {_policy} should be read as a whole and with the overarching objective of ensuring that these crucial elements work together to deliver responsible sharing and {_processing} of {_data}.
