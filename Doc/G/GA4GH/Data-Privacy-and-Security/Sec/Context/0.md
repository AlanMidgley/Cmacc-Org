Ti=Context

1.Ti=Purpose

1.1.sec=Supplementing the {_Framework} and complementing the GA4GH Security Technology Infrastructure, the purpose of this {_policy} is to provide principled and practical guidance for {_processing} {_data} in a way that protects and promotes the security, integrity, and availability of {_data} and services, and the privacy of individuals, families, and communities whose {_data} are processed.

1.2.0.sec=To achieve this purpose, there is a need to:

1.2.1.sec=Ensure {_data_subject}s are informed, as far as is practicable, about the manner in which their {_data} are being used and for what purposes (which may include broad purposes); {_data} protection and security measures and risks; and their rights in relation to their {_data};

1.2.2.sec=Respect {_data_subject}s’ expectations, interests, and rights in relation to their {_data};

1.2.3.sec=Protect against the risk of unauthorized access, use, change, disclosure, or destruction of {_data}; and

1.2.4.sec=Promote the availability of and access to {_data}.

2.Ti=Interpretation

2.1.sec=This {_policy} is intended to be flexible enough to adapt to different contexts, cultures, and countries, as well as different technologies that can impact the privacy and security of {_data}. This {_policy} also should be interpreted in a manner that acknowledges different levels of risk tolerance and community cultural practices and, where appropriate, different contexts of {_data} {_processing}.

2.2.sec=To encourage broad application, this {_policy} adopts the normative term “should” in most instances of the procedural guidance in section II. However, it is acknowledged that depending on the context, certain parts of the procedural guidance may be required or in contrast, be discretionary under law, regulation, or another instrument.

2.3.sec=This {_policy} distinguishes privacy from security. Privacy is treated as a fundamental value and right that protects all aspects of the lives of individuals, families, and communities, and that establishes reasonable limits to {_processing} {_data}. Security refers to the process of protecting {_data} from unauthorized access, use, change, disclosure, and destruction. It also includes the protection from data corruption throughout its lifecycle by considering appropriate network security, physical security, and file security. While the privacy and security aspects of this {_policy} might be addressed to different persons and organizations with diverse responsibilities, this {_policy} should be read as a whole and with the overarching objective of ensuring that these crucial elements work together to deliver responsible sharing and {_processing} of {_data}.

4.Ti=Intended Audience

4.sec=It is expected that this {_policy} will be useful to all persons and organizations providing, storing, accessing, managing, or otherwise using {_data}, and in particular the {_organizational_member}s of the {_GA4GH}. These persons and organizations include, but are not limited to, researchers, research institutions, research participants and patient communities, research ethics committees and {_data} access committees, journal editors and publishers, research funding agencies, {_data} protection supervisory authorities, hospitals, clinicians, industry, ministries of health, and public health organizations.
