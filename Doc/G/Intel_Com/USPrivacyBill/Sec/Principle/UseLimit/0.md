2.Ti=Prohibited Uses

2.0.sec=— Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this Section, a {_covered_entity} shall not {_process} {_personal_data} when the {_covered_entity} knows, or has reason to know, that the {_process}ing of the {_personal_data} will likely:

2.2.sec=interfere with, or deny, individuals their rights and privileges under the United States Constitution.

2.3.sec=Only the forms of {_process}ing or the specific {_process}ing activity that are prohibited by the requirements of section {Principle.Xnum}(d)(2)(A)  or (B) above shall be prohibited. Processing activities that do not meet the requirements shall not be prohibited.

3.Ti=Consistent Uses

3.0.sec=— A {_covered_entity} shall be allowed to {_process} {_personal_data} for purposes consistent with the purposes specified pursuant to Section {Principle.Xnum}(c).  The determination of whether a specific {_process}ing activity is consistent shall be documented and based on a risk/benefits analysis, taking into consideration the following factors:

3.1.sec=the degree to which the individual to whom the {_personal_data} relates would reasonably expect the {_process}ing of the {_personal_data} given the specified purpose;

3.2.sec=the likelihood and severity of {_privacy_risk}s to that individual;

3.3.sec=the potential benefits to that individual;

3.4.sec=the {_privacy_risk}s and potential benefits to other individuals as appropriate; and

3.5.sec=the potential risks and benefits to society, including, but not limited to, the potential impact on the economy, free expression, democratic participation, scientific advancement, public welfare, and the public good.

4.Ti=Automated Processing

Note=Fixed the cross-reference to {_privacy_risk}s - Section 3, not Section 2.

4.0.sec=— Processing of {_personal_data} by algorithmic, machine learning, or artificial intelligence {_process}ing or predictive analytics, without human intervention, shall only be done after the {_covered_entity} conducts an assessment, specific to the automated {_process}ing, which:

4.1.sec=Determines, through objective means, that such {_process}ing, and the results of such {_process}ing, are reasonably free from bias and error, and that the data quality obligations of section {Principle.Xnum}(b) are met;

4.2.sec=analyzes {_privacy_risk}s, as defined in Section {Def.Xnum}(h) of this Act, to the individual. Such assessment shall include the identification of reasonably foreseeable {_privacy_risk}s and mitigation of such {_privacy_risk} to that individual from that {_process}ing, including the potential ethical and legal consequences of {_process}ing for the individual; and 

4.3.sec=Concludes that, after all reasonable steps are taken to mitigate {_privacy_risk}, the automated {_process}ing does not cause, or is not likely to cause, substantial {_privacy_risk}.
