NetSales.2.4.sec=If neither the Licensed Compound nor the Other Components included in the Combination Product were sold or provided separately during the relevant period, then the proration factor will be mutually agreed upon by the parties in good faith based on the relative value contributed by each component and, to the extent the parties are unable to establish such proration factor, then such proration factor will be established by Standard Dispute Resolution. 

NetSales.2.5.sec=In the event that such separate sales were not made or performed during the immediately preceding calendar year (“CY”), then the invoiced amounts for the Combination Product for purposes of calculating Net Sales will be multiplied by the fraction C/(C + D), where C is the average fully burdened cost of manufacture of the Licensed Products during the immediately preceding CY and D is the average fully burdened cost of manufacture of the additional items during the immediately preceding CY, in each case calculated in accordance with GAAP.

NetSales.5.sec=Amounts received or invoiced by Licensee or a Sublicensee for the sale of a Licensed Product among Licensee or a Sublicensee will not be included in the computation of Net Sales, unless the purchasing entity is the end-user of such Licensed Product.
