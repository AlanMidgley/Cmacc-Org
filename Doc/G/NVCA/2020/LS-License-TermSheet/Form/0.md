31.Ti=Award Sharing

31.sec=Any recovery, whether by way of settlement or judgment, from a third party pursuant to a legal proceeding shall first be used to reimburse the initiating party and the non-initiating party for their actual fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with such proceeding.   The initiating party shall divide any remaining amounts from any such settlement or judgment as follows:  (i) any recovery reflecting lost profits damages and/or reasonable royalty damages, Licensee retains or receives such recovery, and Licensor retains or receives the amount of royalties due to Licensor had those activities been performed by Licensee, and (ii) all other remaining amounts (including any punitive or exemplary damages) are divided [75%] to the party who initiated or carried on the proceedings and [25%] to the other party. 

32.Ti=Unmet Needs

32.sec=Licensor would like Licensee to address unmet needs, such as those of neglected patient populations or geographic areas, giving particular attention to improved therapeutics, diagnostics and agricultural technologies for low and middle income countries. If (a) Licensee is unable or unwilling to serve an unmet need for which there is an adequately-resourced company willing to be a Sublicensee, and (b) such potential Sublicensee has provided Licensee with a bona fide, detailed proposal to serve such unmet needs (which Licensee will provide to Licensor), then, unless Licensee can demonstrate to Licensor’s reasonable satisfaction that Licensee will serve such unmet need itself or through another third party, Licensee will, at Licensor’s request, negotiate in good faith a Sublicense with said potential Sublicensee on reasonable commercial terms. If the Sublicense is not executed within [12] months, then Licensor has the right to grant a license to serve such unmet need exclusively or non-exclusively, on reasonable commercial terms that, in the judgement of Licensee, will not impair its business, and Licensor will notify Licensee of such a license. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will Licensee be compelled to negotiate a Sublicense [within the field of X/for X indications], it being understood and agreed that any such Sublicense would be competitive with or otherwise materially impair Licensee's business as proposed to be conducted.

33.Ti=Institution Reservation of Rights

33.sec=Without limiting any other rights it may have, Licensor retains, on behalf of itself, the right to practice or have practiced the Patent Rights, and to use or have used the Licensed Know-How for any research, public service, internal (excluding any studies that are required to be reported to the FDA under 21 CFR Parts 58 and/or 312) and/or educational purposes  with non-profit research institutions, including sponsored research and collaborations with such non-profit research institutions, and to publish their respective results, and the right to grant the same limited rights to other non-profit research institutions; provided that Licensor will, and will include in any grant of rights to such non-profit research institutions the obligation to, use its best efforts to provide a draft of any planned disclosure from the laboratory of [Principal Investigator] based upon the foregoing to Licensee 45 days in advance, and if Licensee determines new patent applications need to be filed in order to protect the Patent Rights, Licensed Know-How or Improvements, then Licensor agrees to delay such disclosure by an additional delay of 45 days during which the Licensee will prepare and file patent applications with respect to the foregoing at its own cost. The grant of rights to the Licensed Technology is subject to any existing right of the U.S. Government under Title 35, United States Code, Section 200 et seq. and under 37 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 401 et seq., (the (“Bayh Dole Act”) including but not limited to the grant to the U.S. Government of a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have practiced any invention conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work for or on behalf of the U.S. Government throughout the world. Licensed Products shall be substantially manufactured in the United States to the extent (if at all) required by 35 U.S.C. Section 204.

34.Ti=Audit

34.sec=No more than once per calendar year, Licensor may appoint a qualified audit firm to audit Licensee’s books and records relating to Licensee’s payments under the License Agreement.  Such audit shall be conducted during normal business hours without unreasonable disruption to Licensee’s business, upon 30 days’ advance written notice to Licensee.  In the event that the audit discloses an underpayment greater than [5-10%] of the amount due, Licensee shall bear the costs of the audit.

37.Ti=Dispute Resolution

37.sec=A senior representative of each party shall first engage in good faith efforts to resolve the dispute, for a period of 30 days from the date that one party notifies the other of its desire to commence Standard Dispute Resolution.  If the dispute is not resolved within such time period, the parties shall submit the matter to arbitration under the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules (with the option to use AAA Expedited Procedures by mutual agreement).  The parties must agree to a single arbitrator, and if they cannot agree, one shall be appointed by the President of the City Bar Association of the city in which one of the parties is located (the choice of such city to be determined by a coin toss), provided that sole arbitrator must be experienced in the structuring and negotiation of licenses and commercial agreements in the life sciences industry and be impartial and independent.  The arbitration will be conducted over a mutually agreed upon video conferencing platform, unless the parties agree to conduct it live in a mutually agreeable location.  Except for the appointment of the arbitrator, which shall follow the timeline set forth in the AAA Road Map (www.adr.org/sites/default/files/document_repository/AAA197_Arbitration_Road_Map.pdf), all the other time periods specified therein shall be cut in half.  The parties waive any rights to punitive damages.  The parties shall evenly share all costs of such arbitration.  This process is referred to as “Standard Dispute Resolution”.
