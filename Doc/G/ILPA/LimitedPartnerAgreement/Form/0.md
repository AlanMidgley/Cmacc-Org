The General Partner shall, subject to such legal, tax or regulatory considerations, cause each Parallel Vehicle to co-invest with the Fund in each Portfolio Company in proportion to the respective capital commitments of the Parallel Vehicles and the Fund.  All references in this Section {2.8.Xnum} (Parallel Vehicles) to the Investors of a Parallel Vehicle shall be deemed to include all Investors in a Parallel Vehicle formed as a vehicle other than a limited partnership.
2.8.2.sec=Each investment by a Parallel Vehicle shall, subject to legal, tax or regulatory considerations, be on substantially the same terms as, and on economic terms that are no more than favorable to such Parallel Vehicle than, those received by the Fund.

2.9.1.sec=If at any time the General Partner determines that for legal, tax or regulatory reasons it would be in the best interests of the Limited Partners for certain or all of the Limited Partners to participate in a Portfolio Investment through one or more alternative investment structures, the General Partner may effect the making of all or any portion of such investment outside of the Fund by requiring certain or all Limited Partners to make capital contributions with respect to such potential portfolio investment to a limited partnership or other similar vehicle (each, an “Alternative Vehicle”) provided that, that no Limited Partner will be required to participate in any such investment through an Alternative Vehicle unless (i) all Limited Partners are participating in such investment through such Alternative Vehicle, or (ii) the General Partner obtains prior written consent from such Limited Partner.  
2.9.2.sec=Each Alternative Vehicle shall be controlled by the General Partner or an Affiliate thereof, shall be managed by the Fund Manager or an Affiliate thereof, and shall be governed by organizational documents containing provisions substantially the same in all material respects as those of the Fund (including this Agreement), with only such differences as may be required to accommodate the legal, tax or regulatory requirements referred to in Section {2.9.1.Xnum}.

With respect to each investment or proposed investment in which an Alternative Vehicle participates or proposes to participate with the Fund, any expenses or indemnification or other obligations related to such investment or proposed investment shall be borne by, and any Fee Income shall be allocated among, the Fund and such Alternative Vehicle in proportion to the capital committed by or proposed to be committed by each to such investment.  Any management fee funded by a Limited Partner with respect to an Alternative Vehicle shall reduce such Limited Partner’s share of the Management Fee required to be funded by such Limited Partner, and payable to the Fund Manager by the Fund by a corresponding amount.  Distributions of cash and other property and the allocations of income, gain, loss, deduction, expense and credit from such Alternative Vehicle, and the determination of allocations and distributions pursuant to Article {14.Xnum} (Distributions; Allocations) and of any Capital Contribution or other payment by a Limited Partner pursuant to Article {6.Xnum} (Capital Contributions) or any other amount contributed to or distributed by any Alternative Vehicle, shall be determined as if each contribution to or distribution by such Alternative Vehicle were a contribution to or distribution by the Fund.  The investment results of an Alternative Vehicle shall be aggregated with the investment results of the Fund for all purposes unless at the time the investment is made by the Alternative Vehicle the General Partner otherwise determines with the consent of the Advisory Committee and prior notice to the Limited Partners, that such aggregation increases the risk of any adverse tax consequences or imposes legal or regulatory constraints or creates other risks that would be undesirable for the Fund or the Limited Partners.  If any Limited Partner defaults with respect to its obligations to an Alternative Vehicle, (i) such Limited Partner shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Partner under this Agreement to the same extent as if such default to the Alternative Vehicle had occurred under the terms of this Agreement and (ii) the remedies imposed by the General Partner against such Defaulting Partner shall be aggregated with the remedies imposed against such Person under the governing documents of the Alternative Vehicle so that, to the greatest extent practicable, such aggregated remedies would put the Fund and the Defaulting Partner in the same positions they each would have been in had such Defaulting Partner made its entire Commitment to the Fund rather than through both the Fund and the Alternative Vehicle.

The limited partnership agreement and other organizational documents of any Alternative Vehicle shall be executed on behalf of the Limited Partners investing therein by the General Partner pursuant to the power of attorney granted by each of the Limited Partners pursuant to Section {19.5.Xnum} (Power of Attorney).

2.10.2.sec=The General Partner shall, after the payments, distributions, reallocations and adjustments described in this Section {2.10.Xnum} (Adjustments Between Vehicles) are taken into account, cause each Portfolio Investment, to the extent practicable and appropriate and subject to adjustments made by the General Partner with respect to any Portfolio Investment realized before the admission of a Subsequent Closing Partner (or equivalent in any Fund Vehicle), shall be held by the Fund Vehicles in such proportions as if all of the Fund Vehicles had a single closing on the Initial Closing Date at which all Limited Partners and limited partners or equivalent investors of all Fund Vehicles were admitted with a commitment equal to their commitment as of the Final Closing Date, and all Partners and investors in any other Fund Vehicle shall have received such amounts by way of distribution of Equalization Payment and Additional Payments (or the equivalent under the documentation relating to any other Fund Vehicle) as they would have received had they all invested in the Fund.  Final determinations regarding such reallocations shall be made by the General Partner within [forty-five (45)] days after the Final Closing Date.

5.Ti=CLOSINGS

5.1.Ti=Subsequent Closings

ProofersNote=It is strange to have a heading "Closings", then a single subsection entitled "Subsequent Closings".  I would suggest that the subheading be removed and the subsection 6.1.* be renumbered as 6.*. Or is something else going on here?

5.1.1.sec=Subject to Section {4.1.Xnum} (Maximum Fund Size), the General Partner shall have full power and authority to schedule one or more additional closings (each such closing, a “Subsequent Closing”) on any date not later than the Final Closing Date to admit one or more additional Limited Partners and to allow any existing Limited Partner to increase its Commitment to the Fund (each such Person, a “Subsequent Closing Partner”).

5.1.4.2.sec=except as provided in Section {4.2.Xnum} (General Partner Commitment), paying to the Fund an amount calculated as interest at a rate per annum equal to [8]% on such Equalization Payment other than any portion attributable to the Management Fee, computed from the Due Date specified in the Drawdown Notices relating to the corresponding Capital Contributions advanced by Prior Partners until the Due Date specified in the Drawdown Notice issued in connection with the Subsequent Closing Partner’s admission or acceptance of increased Commitment (the “Additional Payment”).

Any portion of an Equalization Payment attributable to the Management Fee shall be paid to the Fund Manager. 
5.1.6.sec=The General Partner shall appropriately adjust the Partners’ Capital Contributions, Sharing Percentages and Remaining Commitments and any other relevant items to give effect to the intent of the foregoing.  Additional Payments contributed by a Subsequent Closing Partner shall not be treated as Capital Contributions and shall not reduce such Subsequent Closing Partner’s Remaining Commitment.  For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any Subsequent Closing Partner, its Preferred Return shall be calculated from the date as if it had been admitted at the Initial Closing Date.

6.2.6.sec=If participation by Benefit Plan Investors is “significant” as determined under the Plan Asset Regulation or if the General Partner otherwise so determines, then (notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section {6.2.Xnum} (Terms and Conditions; Capital Contributions)), no Capital Contribution shall be made to the Fund by a Benefit Plan Investor until the Fund makes a Portfolio Investment that qualifies the Fund as a VCOC.  In such event, prior to the time when the Fund first qualifies as a VCOC, any Capital Contributions of Benefit Plan Investors (and, if determined by the General Partner, other Partners) required by any Drawdown shall be deferred or contributed to an escrow fund established by the General Partner, which escrow fund is intended to comply with Department of Labor Advisory Opinion 95 04A (and, upon the release of such Capital Contributions to consummate a Portfolio Investment, all Temporary Investment Income earned thereon shall be either returned to the Partners in the same proportion as the Partners made such Capital Contributions or paid to the Fund on behalf of the applicable Partners as Capital Contributions).

6.3.2.sec=If at any time following the delivery of any Drawdown Notice it is intended to use any part of the relevant Drawdown for a purpose other than that specified in such Drawdown Notice then, at least ten (10) Business Days prior to such use, the General Partner shall provide to each Limited Partner a revised Drawdown Notice with the intention and the effect that each Limited Partner has the opportunity to exercise any right to be an Excused Limited Partner that it has with respect to such Drawdown pursuant to Section {6.7.Xnum} (Excused Limited Partners). 
6.3.=[G/Z/ol/s2]

6.4.Ti=Reinvestment

6.4.sec=The Remaining Commitments of each Limited Partner that are available to be drawn down shall be increased by the aggregate amount of Distributable Proceeds that have been distributed to such Limited Partner that equals the aggregate amount of Capital Contributions of such Limited Partner used to fund (i) the Acquisition Cost of Portfolio Investments that were realized within [twelve (12)] months of the acquisition thereof, and (ii) Fund Expenses, Management Fees and Organizational Expenses, provided in each case that such increased Remaining Commitments may be used solely for the purpose of making Portfolio Investments.

6.6.Ti=Defaulting Partners

6.6.1.sec=Subject to Section {6.7.Xnum} (Excused Limited Partners), if any Partner fails to make all or any portion of any Capital Contribution or any other amount required to be funded by such Limited Partner pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or any corresponding agreement or with respect to any other Fund Vehicle (including, but not limited to, the obligation to return and contribute distributions to the Fund pursuant to Section {14.7.Xnum} (Clawback) or Section {16.3.Xnum} (Limited Partner Giveback)), the General Partner shall notify such Partner in writing of such failure (a “Default Notice”).  If such failure continues for [five (5)] Business Days after receipt by such Limited Partner of the Default Notice, then such Partner shall be designated by the General Partner as in “Default” under this Agreement (a “Defaulting Partner”) and shall thereafter be subject to the provisions of this Section {6.6.Xnum} (Defaulting Partners).  The General Partner may, if it determines this to be in the best interests of the Fund and the Non-Defaulting Partners, choose not to designate any Partner as a Defaulting Partner and may agree to waive or permit the cure of any Default by a Partner, subject to such conditions as the General Partner and the Defaulting Partner may agree upon, provided that any such decision not to designate any Affiliated Partner as a Defaulting Partner or to waive or permit the cure of any Default by an Affiliated Partner shall be subject to the prior written consent of the Advisory Committee. 
6.6.2.sec=The General Partner shall inform the Limited Partners of the occurrence of any such Default and of any action taken by it with respect to any Defaulting Partner within [thirty (30)] days of the Defaulting Partner becoming a Defaulting Partner. 
6.6.3.sec=A Limited Partner that fails to make all or any portion of any Capital Contribution or other payment required pursuant to this Agreement on the relevant Due Date shall pay or reimburse the Fund for any Damages resulting therefrom.  In addition, any amounts that are not duly paid on the relevant Due Date shall accrue interest at a rate of [10]% per annum from the Due Date as specified in the relevant Default Notice until the date the Limited Partner makes the Capital Contribution.  Any proceeds received by the Fund pursuant to this Section {6.6.3.Xnum} and Section {6.6.4.Xnum}, including any amounts that would otherwise have been distributed to such Defaulting Partner, shall (i) first be applied to reimburse the Fund Parties for any related costs and expenses incurred due to such Defaulting Partner’s Default as determined by the General Partner and notified to the Defaulting Partner by the General Partner, and (ii) thereafter be distributed to the Limited Partners who are not Defaulting Partners (the “Non-Defaulting Partners”) pursuant to Article {14.Xnum} (Distributions; Allocations) if attributable to a Portfolio Investment and otherwise in proportion to their Commitments (provided that a Non-Defaulting Partner shall not receive a distribution with respect to a Portfolio Investment with respect to which such Limited Partner is an Excused Limited Partner).  
6.6.4.0.sec=Without prejudice to Section {6.6.3.Xnum} above or Section {6.6.8.Xnum} below, the General Partner in its sole discretion, on its own behalf or on behalf of the Fund, may (but shall not be obligated to) pursue and enforce any and all rights and remedies the Fund, the General Partner or the Fund Manager may have against such Defaulting Partner at law, in equity or pursuant to any other provision of this Agreement or otherwise with respect thereto, including taking any or all of the following actions in any order of priority (it being understood and agreed that the taking of one or more actions (including those set forth herein), or no action at all, by the General Partner with respect to a Defaulting Partner pursuant to this Section {6.6.4.Xnum} shall in no way restrict or otherwise limit the General Partner’s ability to take one or more actions not prohibited by this Agreement, or no action at all, or in a different order of priority, with respect to any other Defaulting Partner pursuant to this Section {6.6.4.Xnum}):
6.6.4.1.sec=determine that the Defaulting Partner shall not be entitled to receive any or a portion of the distributions from the Fund (which amounts shall be forfeited by such Defaulting Partner) that would otherwise be made to the Defaulting Partner pursuant to this Agreement and may apply such withheld distributions to offset any defaulted amount owing by the Defaulting Partner to the Fund or any Alternative Vehicle;
6.6.4.2.sec=determine that the Defaulting Partner’s Interest may be sold for a purchase price equal to [50]% of the lesser of (i) such Defaulting Partner’s aggregate Capital Contributions, or (ii) the Value of such Defaulting Partner’s Interest at the time of such Default, in each case net of any amounts payable to the Fund pursuant to Section {6.6.3.Xnum}, provided that any such offer may, to a Person that is an Interested Person, only be made with the prior written consent of the Advisory Committee, and provided, further that such Defaulting Partner shall remain subject to Section {16.3.Xnum} (Limited Partner Giveback) and upon such Transfer the Defaulting Partner shall otherwise cease to be a Limited Partner;
6.6.4.3.sec=determine that the Defaulting Partner must forfeit up to 100% of its Interest in the Fund without payment or other consideration therefor, in which case the Non-Defaulting Partners shall be entitled to acquire such forfeited portion of the Defaulting Partner’s Interest in the Fund divided among such Non-Defaulting Partners pro rata according to their respective Remaining Commitments with any adjustment that the General Partner may determine to be equitable in order to reflect any excuse pursuant to Section {6.7.Xnum} (Excused Limited Partners).  The sole consideration to the Defaulting Partner for each portion of such Defaulting Partner’s Interest reallocated to a Non-Defaulting Partner shall be the assumption by such Non-Defaulting Partner of the Defaulting Partner’s obligation to make both defaulted and future Capital Contributions pursuant to its Commitment that are commensurate with the portion of the Defaulting Partner’s Interest being reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Partner.  The Defaulting Partner acknowledges that it shall not receive any payment for any Interest reallocated to Non-Defaulting Partners pursuant to this Section {6.6.4.3.Xnum}, including for any funded portion of its Commitment related thereto or such Defaulting Partner’s share of any profits not yet distributed, even though the purchased Interest may actually have significant positive value at the time of such reallocation or purchase; and
6.6.4.4.sec=determine to reduce any portion of such Defaulting Partner’s Commitment (which has not been assumed by another Partner) to the amount of the Capital Contributions (which have not been acquired) made by such Defaulting Partner (net of distributions pursuant to Article {14.Xnum} (Distributions; Allocations)), and the aggregate Commitments of the Fund shall be commensurately reduced and any such determination shall be binding on such Defaulting Partner.

6.6.5.sec=Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided herein, so long as a Defaulting Partner is a Partner in the Fund nothing contained in Section {6.6.4.Xnum} shall affect the obligation of such Defaulting Partner to pay any such part of its Remaining Commitment to the Fund in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and the Defaulting Partner shall remain fully liable for the fulfilment of its payment obligations hereunder, notwithstanding any other rights and remedies the Fund and the General Partner may have pursuant to applicable law.
6.6.6.sec=With respect to any amount (other than the Management Fee) that is in Default, the General Partner may require additional Drawdowns from the Non-Defaulting Partners in proportion to their Remaining Commitments; provided that no Limited Partner shall be obligated as a result thereof to contribute an additional amount in excess of the lesser of such Limited Partner’s Remaining Commitment and [50]% of the total Capital Contributions that such Limited Partner was originally required to make before the Drawdown of such additional amounts.
6.6.7.sec=A Defaulting Partner shall cease to have any voting or consent rights as a Limited Partner or with regard to its representative in the Advisory Committee (if applicable for such Defaulting Partner), and all acts, consents and decisions with respect to the Fund to be made by the Limited Partners or the Advisory Committee shall be calculated and made by the other Limited Partners without regard for the Commitment or (if applicable) the Advisory Committee member of such Defaulting Partner.
6.6.8.sec=The General Partner shall, in addition to the provisions of Section {6.6.4.Xnum}, have with respect to a Default by a Defaulting Partner the right to pursue all remedies at law (including claiming damages in addition to any forfeiture of Interest pursuant to Section {6.6.4.Xnum}) or in equity or by statute or otherwise.  No course of dealing between the General Partner and any Defaulting Partner and no delay in exercising any right, power or remedy conferred in this Section {6.6.8.Xnum} now or hereafter existing at law shall operate as a waiver or otherwise prejudice any such right, power or remedy.  In addition to the foregoing, the General Partner may institute a lawsuit against any Defaulting Partner for specific performance of its obligations to make Capital Contributions and to collect any overdue amounts hereunder, with interest on such overdue amounts at the rate specified in Section {6.6.3.Xnum}.
6.6.9.sec=[Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided herein, and for the avoidance of doubt, if an Affiliated Partner becomes a Defaulting Partner, all determinations as to actions or waivers with respect to such Affiliated Partner shall constitute a conflict for the purposes of Section {9.5.Xnum} (Other Conflicts of Interest) and accordingly be subject to the prior written consent of the Advisory Committee.]

A Partner’s obligations to comply with the requirements of this Section {15.4.Xnum} (Code Section 83 Safe Harbor Election) shall survive such Partner’s ceasing to be a Partner of the Fund and the termination, dissolution, liquidation and winding up of the Fund, and, for purposes of this Section {15.4.Xnum} (Code Section 83 Safe Harbor Election), the Fund shall be treated as continuing in existence.
15.4.2.sec=Each Partner authorizes the General Partner to amend this Section {15.4.Xnum} (Code Section 83 Safe Harbor Election) to the extent necessary to achieve similar tax treatment with respect to any interest in the Fund transferred to a service provider by the Fund in connection with services provided to the Fund as set forth in Section 4 of the IRS Notice (e.g., to reflect changes from the rules set forth in the IRS Notice in subsequent U.S. Department of Treasury or Internal Revenue Service guidance).

15.5.2.sec=The General Partner shall cause the Fund not to engage, directly or indirectly, in a transaction that, as of the date the Fund enters into a binding contract to engage in such transaction, would cause a Limited Partner subject to the excise tax in Section 4965 of the Code to be treated as a party to a “prohibited tax shelter transaction” for purposes of Section 4965 of the Code.  If the General Partner reasonably determines that the Fund has engaged, directly or indirectly, in a transaction that is a prohibited tax shelter transaction, the General Partner shall promptly notify the affected Limited Partners of such determination and permit such Limited Partners to be excused from participating in such transaction or having any economic rights or liabilities associated with such transaction.
