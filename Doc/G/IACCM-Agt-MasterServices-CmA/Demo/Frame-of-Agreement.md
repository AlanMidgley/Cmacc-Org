/=This shows the frame of a contract agreement with two parties, and the sections for a Master Services Agreement.  There are 8 alternative organizations of the sections.  Each organization has the same 34 sections.  Alt1 was the original, and had them as a flat list from 1 to 34.  Alt2 combines some as subheadings, Alt3 combines some more, etc.  Alt8 is my preference, because it brings the business points up front and the legal terms are in the back.  Alt8 also has a notion of "Variable" - which are defined terms that are business points and often change.  This separates them from the rest of the Defined Terms, which are intended to be a stable vocabulary, and are in the back.

/=We reference a frame for the agreement.  This has two parties and assumes a US style.  There are alternatives for more parties and for other jurisdictions.
