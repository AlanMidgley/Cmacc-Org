Ti=The Right to Proportionality and to Justification of Exceptions to the Principles of Open Governments

1.sec=Open Government presupposes certain principles, such as the right to access information, the right to information reuse or the right to citizen participation; all of which may have exceptions. An open government should grant its citizens the right to proportionality and to justification of the exceptions to the principles of open governments.

2.sec=An open government should commit to limit its exceptions and to constantly justify them.

3.sec=Once such exceptions are established, a jurisdiction should be capable of ensuring that these exceptions are justified and proportionate to the pursued objective.

4.sec=Due to the principle of proportionality, the opening of public information should not hinder fundamental citizen rights. Once these actions are justified by general interest, a jurisdiction should ensure that they are not disproportionate to the objective pursued.
