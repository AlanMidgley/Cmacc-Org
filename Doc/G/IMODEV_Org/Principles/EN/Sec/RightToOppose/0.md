Ti=The Right to Protection of Actors of the Opening of Governments

1.sec=An Open Government should establish a legal framework to protect members of the opposition and/or the minoritiesâ€™ opinions.

2.sec=An open government should commit to establish a legal framework that protects its actors, who collaborate with the respect of democratic principles and that work in favor of open governments.

3.sec=The right to public information leads to the right of transmitting information, if these communications pursue general interest and are proportional to other rights. Therefore, an open government should ensure a protective status for journalists and whistleblowers, providing them the exemption against prosecution for facts revealed in such conditions; the right to omit their sources; and the right to protection.

4.sec=An open government should limit its surveillance equipment over its population. Once these devices are deployed, a jurisdiction should have the capabilities to ensure that they strictly account for a cause of action of general interest and that they are not disproportionate to the objective they intend to achieve.
