Ti=Right to Transparency and Access to Public Information

1.sec=An Open Government should carry out its actions through a transparency rationale as much as possible.

2.sec=The right to transparency is a corollary of the right to information access. A good open government should grant its citizens, in brief and reasonable delay, the right to access the most complete information possible; where the limits to this right to public information should be strictly defined and regularly revised.

3.sec=The right to access public information should only be limited by the respect of privacy and the protection of sensitive information pertaining to sectors of strategic relevance or matters of national sovereignty.

4.sec=An independent authority (administrative or judiciary) should guarantee the effectiveness of the right to public information; it should be capable of addressing injunctions and sanctions to the levels of administration that inhibit the right to access public information (which comprises the excessively slow publication).
