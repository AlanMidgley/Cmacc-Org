Ti=The Right to Reuse Public Information

1.sec=If the right to access public information is essential, it is also crucial to promote its reuse, which is a driver of democratic enhancement. Therefore, an open government should allow, as much as possible, the reuse of public information.

2.sec=The effectiveness or the right to access public information presupposes that governments and public institutions will make available their data and documents in an open, raw and reusable format.

3.sec=An open government should develop a data public service and dedicate means to ensure high quality policy on the subject.

4.sec=The governments should commit to authorize, as much as possible, the free reuse of public information. The gratuity does not exclude the possibility of finding specific funding models for the service, seen as they are intended to ensure the outreach of public data of good quality. The funding can stand on, for example, supplementary benefits performed by the data service; as long as these actions do not prevent citizens from exercising their right to access and reuse the reference data gratuitously.
