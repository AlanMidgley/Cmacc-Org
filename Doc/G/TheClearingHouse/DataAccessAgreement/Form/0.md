13.2.sec=Each {_Party} will treat all Confidential Information of the other {_Party} as confidential and will disclose such Confidential Information only to those individuals with a reasonable need to know within their organizations (provided that such individuals are bound by the confidentiality obligations in the {_Agreement}). Each {_Party} will use at least the same degree of care to prevent disclosing to third parties the Confidential Information of the other as it employs to avoid unauthorized disclosure, publication or dissemination of its own information of a similar nature, but in no event less than a reasonable standard of care. A {_Party} may disclose Confidential Information of the other {_Party} to advisors, Auditors and other Representatives necessary to perform, assess or interpret such {_Party}’s obligations under the {_Agreement}, and subject to such third party agreeing to confidentiality obligations substantially equivalent to those set forth in the {_Agreement}, where (a) the use of such an entity is authorized under the {_Agreement} or such disclosure is reasonably necessary to or otherwise naturally occurs in that third party's scope of responsibility and solely for the benefit and (b) the disclosure is in accordance with the {_Agreement}.
