Ti=What will you do with my data and samples?

1.sec=We will store your data and samples securely, along with the data and samples from all the other people who take part in All of Us. Researchers will use the data and samples to make discoveries.

2.sec=We will create a public database on the All of Us website. The data in the public database will be about the group. It will not include data about individual people. It will not include your name or other data that directly identifies you. Everyone will be able to use the public database to make discoveries.

3.sec=We will also create a scientific database. The scientific database will have individual-level data and samples. Access to this database will be controlled. Researchers will have to be approved by All of Us to use this database. These researchers may be from anywhere in the world. They may work for commercial companies, like drug companies. They may be citizen scientists. Citizen scientists are people who do science in their spare time. Their research may be on nearly any topic. You can learn more about the research being done at www.joinallofus.org.

4.sec=Except if you withdraw( “quit”) or there are limits imposed by law, there is no limit on the length of time we will store your samples and data. Researchers will use your samples and data for research long into the future.
