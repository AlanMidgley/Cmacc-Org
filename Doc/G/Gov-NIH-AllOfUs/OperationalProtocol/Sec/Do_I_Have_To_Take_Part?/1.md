Ti=Do I have to take part?

1.sec=Taking part in All of Us is voluntary. You can choose to join or not. No matter what you decide, now or in the future, it will not affect your medical care.

2.sec=If you decide to join All of Us, you can change your mind at any time. If you decide you want to withdraw (quit), you need to tell us. You can tell us through the app or website, or use the contact information at the end of this form to call or write to us.

3.sec=If you withdraw, your samples will be destroyed. Your data will not be used for new studies. However, if researchers already have your data or samples for their studies, we at All of Us cannot get it back. Also, we will let researchers check the results of past studies. If they need your old data to do this work, we will give it to them.

4.sec=Even if you withdraw, we will keep your name and contact information. We keep this information so we can follow U.S. research laws and regulations.
