Ti=Will I find out the results of the research?

0.sec=Results explain or interpret data. All of Us involves two kinds of results: results about you and results about the group.

1.Ti=Results about you

1.0.sec=We may tell you if there are results about you. You will be able to choose if you want to see these results.

1.1.Ti=• Results that might change your medical care

1.1.sec=These are results that could be used by a healthcare provider to take better care of you. For example, if any of your physical measurements are outside of what we would expect, we will tell you so you can follow-up with your healthcare provider. You will have to pay for the cost of follow-up care with your own healthcare provider.

1.2.Ti=• Results that would not change your medical care

1.2.sec=These results might be interesting to you, but a healthcare provider probably would not use them to take better care of you. For example, these results might come from tests that are still experimental.

2.Ti=Results about the group

2.sec=These are reports of what researchers learn about health from studying data from all the different people in the All of Us Research Program. You can get these reports, as well as general news and updates about All of Us at <a href="www.joinallofus.org">www.joinallofus.org</a>.
