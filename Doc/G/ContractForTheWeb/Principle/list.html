The <a href="http://ContractForTheWeb.org">ContractForTheWeb.org</a> is an initiative of the World Wide Web Foundation to protect and improve the internet as a human resource.<br>

Here we have the basic Principles expressed as Prose Objects.  They are different than a "Data Sharing" agreement, but have some similarities with sharing arrangements such as the Chatham House principles for NGOs or the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health's Data Sharing and Data Security Principles.<br>

Somewhat abusively, this is therefore including in the list of <a href="index.php?action=source&file=S/Index/DataSharing/Frameworks.md">S/Index/DataSharing/Frameworks.md</a><br>

The goal of this is to show synergies between these Principles and the other work on Prose Objects, both with respect to the legal aspects and to the Semantic Web expression.<br>

Go to "Form" below to see the all the Principles expressed as a single document.
