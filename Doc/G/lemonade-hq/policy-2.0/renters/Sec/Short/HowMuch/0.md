Ti=For how much?

1.sec={CoverageOption.Sec}

2.sec=These amounts indicate the maximum we will reimburse you, in total, per year - even if the losses you suffer are larger.

3.sec=So take a minute to imagine the stuff belonging to everyone on the policy going up in flames tomorrow (ouch). Remember to include everyone's clothes, furniture, jewelry, cameras, laptops, and phones.

4.sec=If {CoverageOption.Stuff.Total.$} isn’t enough to cover everything, please <b>{Policy.Coverage.Increase.Link}</b>. And if you own any valuable items worth more than {CoverageOption.Stuff.PerItem.$}, be sure to <b>{Policy.AddValuableItemsToPolicy.Link}</b> so they’re covered for their full amount.
