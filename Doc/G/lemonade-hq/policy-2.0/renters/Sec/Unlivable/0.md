Ti=If your home becomes unlivable

1.Ti=Theft, vandalism, fires, and burst pipes in your building can make it unlivable. If any of these happen, we’ll help.

1.sec=We will pay for reasonable increased living costs caused due to theft, vandalism, fire, smoke, burst pipes or appliance leaks in your building, or mandatory evacuation of your building. We’ll cover costs of an AirBnB or hotel accommodation while your home remains unlivable, up to {CoverageOption.LivingExpense.Total.$} per year. If you’d like more coverage, you can increase it <a href="In the real doc, this will open our Live Policy editor">here</a>.

2.Ti=What’s not covered

2.1.sec=All other things that make your home unlivable are not covered. So if your flight got canceled, your neighbors are noisy, your heating or AC is broken, your power failed, the water supply stopped, or your home is infested with bedbugs or other wildlife, you’re not covered.

2.2.sec=And just like damage to your stuff, we do not cover you if the damage was intentional, foreseeable or preventable by you, or relates to illegal activity by you.
