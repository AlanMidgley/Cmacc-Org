1.sec=Except for the rights explicitly granted hereunder, this {_Licence} does not imply or represent any transfer or assignment of intellectual property rights to the {_Licensee}.

2.sec={_You} shall not use any of the name (including acronyms and abbreviations), image, or logo by which the {_Licensor} or CERN is known, except where  needed to  comply with section {Copy.Xnum}, or where the use is otherwise allowed by law. Any such permitted use shall be factual and shall not be made so as to suggest any kind of endorsement by the {_Licensor} or its personnel of the modified {_Covered_Source} or any {_Product}, or any kind of implication by the {_Licensor} or its personnel in the preparation of the modified {_Covered_Source} or {_Product}.

3.sec=CERN may publish updated versions and variants of this {_Licence} which it considers to be in the spirit of this version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. New versions and variants will be published with a unique version number (for versions) and type identifier (for variants). If the {_Licensor} specifies that a given variant applies to the {_Covered_Source} without specifying a version, {_You} may treat that {_Source} as being released under any version of that variant that has been published by CERN. If no variant is specified, the {_Covered_Source} shall be treated as being released under CERN-OHL2-S. For a given variant, the {_Licensor} may specify that the {_Source} is subject to a specific version of that variant or any later version published by CERN from time to time.

4.sec=This {_Licence} shall not be enforceable except by a {_Licensor} acting as such, and third party beneficiary rights are specifically excluded.
