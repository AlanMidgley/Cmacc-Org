The basic framework for contract agreements.  Extended into a number of languages.

Multilingual basic frames for contract agreements. Derived from Agt-Form-CmA. Only an /EN/ form presented here, derived from the /US/ form of Agt-Form-CmA. 

The idea is to use this as a base for all contract agreements.  It becomes both a "style guide" and a taxonomy.  That improves human reading because of the standard form, and greatly facilitates machine reading. 

Note=Uses of this can be seen across the website - for instance at:
