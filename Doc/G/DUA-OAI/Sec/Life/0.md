Ti=Term and Termination

1.sec=This {_Agreement} is effective as of the Effective Date and will continue until the first anniversary of the Effective Date, at which time this {_Agreement} will automatically terminate unless extended by mutual written agreement of the parties.

Comment: The Agreement does not automatically renew because (1) the Data Provider is likely to want a finite end to Data User’s data retention rights, (2) the Data User is likely to want a finite end to its obligations under this Agreement, especially in view of the fact that the data will become stale at some point, and (3) changes in data privacy laws (or other laws) may necessitate adjustment to the contractual terms over time.

2.sec=Either party may terminate this {_Agreement} if the other party has materially breached the {_Agreement} and has failed to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of written notification of such breach by the other party.

3.sec=Either party may terminate this {_Agreement} for any reason on ninety (90) days’ prior written notice to the other party.

Comment: Ninety days was selected to provide Data User with ample time to “wind down” use of the Training Data. This timeframe can be tailored for the particular scenario at issue.

4.sec=The following Sections of this {_Agreement} will survive termination of this {_Agreement}: Sections 1, 3b (for the duration of the retention period, if any), 3c (for one (1) year following termination or expiration of this {_Agreement} and thereafter until such date as {_Data_User} ceases use of the {_Trained_Model}), 4, 6, 7 (for any period during which {_Data_User} has possession or control of the {_Training_Data}), 8d and 9.
