Intro.sec=For the purposes of this Policy, terms are defined as follows:

Data_Management_and_Sharing_Plan.sec=Data Management and Sharing Plan (Plan): A plan describing how scientific data will be managed, preserved, and shared with others (e.g., researchers, institutions, the broader public), as appropriate.
 
Data_Management.sec=Data Management: The process of validating, organizing, securing, maintaining, and processing scientific data, and of determining which scientific data to preserve.

Data_Sharing.sec=Data Sharing: The act of making scientific data available for use by others (e.g., researchers, institutions, the broader public).

Metadata.sec=Metadata: Data describing scientific data that provide additional information to make such scientific data more understandable (e.g., date, independent sample and variable description, outcome measures, and any intermediate, descriptive, or phenotypic observational variables).
 
Scientific_Data.sec=Scientific Data: The recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate and replicate research findings, regardless of whether the data are used to support scholarly publications. Scientific data do not include laboratory notebooks, preliminary analyses, completed case report forms, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer reviews, communications with colleagues, or physical objects, such as laboratory specimens. NIH expects that reasonable efforts will be made to digitize all scientific data.
