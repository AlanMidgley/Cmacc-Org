Note=Article 4 Annotation: This provision underscores the need for the parties to describe clearly and comprehensively their respective roles and responsibilities in sharing data. It provides a ‘roadmap’ for actions the data provider and data recipient should take to ensure data sharing activities are implemented effectively and within the bounds of applicable law. Data providers and data recipients will have to comply with legal rules in their respective jurisdictions even if they decide their agreement is not legally binding.


Ti=Responsibilities in Sharing Public Health Surveillance Data

1.Note=Article 4.1 Annotation: Productive data sharing efforts reflect good data management practices, and those involved in such sharing should identify how they will manage the data they share. The Model Agreement has the parties develop a data management plan for each data sharing activity planned, as guided by a template in Annex B of the Model Agreement. In addition, the Model Agreement identifies general objectives (e.g. data quality and security, system interoperability, and privacy protection) that data management plans should be developed to achieve.

1.Ti=Data Management Plan

1.0.sec=For each {_Activity}, the {_Parties} shall develop and implement a plan to guide the collection, transfer, storage, and security of public health surveillance data and include the plan as Annex B of the {_Agreement} (“Data Management Plan”). The {_Parties} shall use the Data Management Plan to:

1.1.sec=Collect and share high quality data for the public health need addressed by an {_Activity};

1.2.sec=Achieve interoperability between data systems of the {_Data_Provider} and {_Data_Recipient};

1.3.sec=Incorporate, as appropriate, internationally accepted standards and best practices on conducting surveillance and sharing public health surveillance data;

1.4.sec=Protect data from unauthorized access, manipulation, and use; and

1.5.sec=Integrate confidentiality protections into the management of public health surveillance data collected, shared, and analysed in an {_Activity}.

Note=Articles 4.2 and 4.3 Annotation: The data management plan will describe specific responsibilities the data provider and data recipient have in the data sharing activities planned. In addition, the Model Agreement identifies more general responsibilities for the data provider (Article 4.2 above) and the data recipient (Article 4.3 below). A number of these responsibilities arise from the different legal systems under which the data provider and data recipient operate. Other responsibilities address more functional issues, such as the data recipient’s responsibility to comply with any restrictions on the transfer of shared data to third parties.

2.Ti=Responsibilities of the {_Data_Provider}

2.0.sec=The {_Data_Provider} shall be responsible for: 

2.1.sec=Ensuring that all aspects of the {_Agreement} and each {_Activity} are compatible with the laws and regulations that apply to the {_Data_Provider};

2.2.sec=Obtaining all governmental consents or approvals required by law or regulation to undertake an {_Activity};

2.3.sec=Fulfilling legal and ethical requirements relating to gaining consent from individuals or communities to collect, share, and use public health surveillance data under an {_Activity}; 

2.4.sec=Using systems that protect the integrity of the data and prevent unauthorized access; and

2.5.sec=Providing the {_Data_Recipient} with information about all legal or regulatory requirements of the {_Data_Provider}’s jurisdiction that apply to the {_Data_Recipient}’s access to and use of public health surveillance data in an {_Activity}.

3.4.sec=Storing, analysing, and using public health surveillance data in an {_Activity} in a manner that protects the integrity of the data and protects the data from unauthorized access;

3.5.sec=Notifying the {_Data_Provider} promptly of any instances of non-compliance with the limitations and conditions applied to the sharing and use of public health surveillance data in an {_Activity} as set out in the {_Agreement} and its Annexes

3.6.sec=Protecting privacy with respect to public health surveillance data in an {_Activity}, a responsibility that remains in place after the {_Agreement} expires or is terminated until the {_Data_Recipient} has deleted and/or destroyed the shared data in their entirety; and

3.7.sec=Having the capacity necessary to accomplish the tasks the {_Data_Recipient} has to fulfil in an {_Activity}.

4.Note=Article 4.4 Annotation: The data provider and data recipient will have some common responsibilities that a data sharing agreement should describe. The common responsibilities contained in this provision ensure stability in the rights and responsibilities each party has and protect the confidentiality of information exchanged in data sharing activities.

4.Ti=Common Responsibilities of the {_Data_Provider} and {_Data_Recipient}.

4.1.sec=Neither {_Party} may assign its rights under the {_Agreement} to another entity without the written consent of the other {_Party}, unless explicitly agreed at the outset.
