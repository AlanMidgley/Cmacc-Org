Appendix C
Antitrust Policy
Those participating in ID Federation activities of any type should be aware of the need to exercise caution to avoid inadvertent violations of EU, international, national or state/province antitrust and anticompetitive laws. Violations of such laws can result in severe civil penalties (and in some jurisdictions, criminal penalties) for individuals as well as their employers.
Laws relating to antitrust and anticompetitive behavior can be quite complex, and differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Consequently, it is not possible to summarize them in this policy, and you should therefore consult appropriate advisors at your own company for detailed guidance.
The following rules shall apply in connection with all ID Federation meetings, activities, and other forms of participation:
1. Agendas must be created, and minutes must be taken, for all ID Federation meetings. These agendas and minutes must then be submitted to ID Federation, along with any meeting materials, to document the topics discussed and any agreements reached.
2. Certain topics should never be discussed at, or in connection with, any ID Federation meeting or other ID Federation activity, nor should you ever form an agreement with any other ID Federation Member or any one else in connection with these topics. In particular, DO NOT at any time discuss, or agree upon:
 Your current or future prices, or any strategies relating to pricing
 Any increase or decrease in prices, or other terms (e.g., discounts) relating to prices
 Your market shares or those of others
 Levels of investment or development, or changes to such levels
 Your current or future design or marketing strategies.
 How much or little you are capable of producing or will sell of any product or service
 Whether you have submitted a bid, or will or will not bid, in any given situation
 Where each of you will or will not sell any product or service
 Whether you will or will not deal with any third party
3. Do not disclose or discuss at or in connection with any ID Federation meeting or activity any terms upon which you will make any of your intellectual property rights available, except to the extent permitted or required under the ID Federation IPR Policy.
If at any time you become aware of any activity that may be in violation of any of the above rules, please bring them promptly to the attention of an ID Federation representative.
REMEMBER: All ID Federation activities must serve to promote, rather than restrict, competition to the benefit of consumers and the marketplace. Activities that do otherwise, or even appear to have the potential to do otherwise, may have serious consequences.
