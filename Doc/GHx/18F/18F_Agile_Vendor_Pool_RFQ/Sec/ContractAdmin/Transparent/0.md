Ti={_18F}'s Transparency Policy

1.sec=Vendors are advised that {_18F} will publish on a publicly available website documents associated with this requirement, including any Requests for Quotation (including amendments), Question and Answer exchanges with vendors (source-identifying information removed), and other relevant information that is not confidential/proprietary in nature or source selection sensitive information that would otherwise implicate procurement integrity concerns.

2.sec=Upon award, {_18F} will publish the total price of the selected proposal and certain non-source-identifying data (e.g., the number of bids, the mean price, median, and standard deviation of price). During the performance of this task order, {_18F} will similarly publish source code, data related to project management (e.g., user stories, milestones, and performance metrics), and top-line spending data.
