Ti=Basis for Award

1.sec=The final award for this requirement will be based on best-value principles. Accordingly, award will be made to the responsible and technically acceptable Offerors whose proposals provide the greatest overall value to the Government, price and other factors considered.

2.sec=This best-value determination will be accomplished by comparing the value of the differences in the technical factors for competing offers under consideration in the technical evaluation, based on their strengths, weaknesses, and risks, with differences in their price to the Government.

3.sec=In making this comparison, the Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical and management capabilities than with making awards at the lowest overall price to the Government. However, the Government will not make awards at a significantly higher overall price to achieve slightly superior technical value. Offerors are advised that the technical evaluation factors combined are significantly more important than price.
