3.7.sec=This has no technical artifact in UMA, and therefore no exact or obvious moment of appearing "on stage" for our work. Does this have an impact on whether it is in scope based on the rationale above? We agreed there are definitely reasons to have UMA-specific clauses, looking at our draft ones.
Grantor - RSO

4.1.sec=RSO - ASO

4.2.sec=Yes

4.3.sec=Resource protection agreement

4.4.sec=PAT

4.5.sec=OAuth client credentials for RS

4.6.sec=It's awkward to have a two-party agreement resting on a PAT. There are plenty of agreements where there are multiple Persons in one of the roles, but we're not so sure about true three-role agreements.

5.7.sec=We have not scrutinized the definition of Client Operator. Let's put a pin in that to be sure it's okay.

8.5.sec=OAuth client credentials for RS, PAT, OAuth client credentials for Client, AAT

8.6.sec=Could be in the form of a consent receipt, sent to a notification endpoint. Is this trust relationship too "dependent" to be in scope, or does the calculus work? More discussion is needed.
