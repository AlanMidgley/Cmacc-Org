Title=Summary of Model Clauses and Supporting Terminology for Parties Serving in {UMA} Roles

Introduction.sec=This document gathers together a series of model clauses representing a minimum set of commitments that parties serving in roles defined by the {UMA} specifications are assumed to adopt, if the parties are operating and using software programs and services in an environment where the operators declare themselves to be {UMA}-conforming and the parties formally agree (for example, in the form of contracts using these clauses) to such terms. The clauses are encoded in a system known as CommonAccord, which allows for reusability of each clause, term and abbreviation definitions, and individual phrases within each.
