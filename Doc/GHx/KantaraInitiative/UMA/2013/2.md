Title=Summary of Model Clauses and Supporting Terminology for Parties Serving in {UMA} Roles

Introduction.sec=<h1>Introduction</h1><p>This document gathers together a series of model clauses representing a minimum set of commitments that parties serving in roles defined by the {UMA} specifications are assumed to adopt. The clauses assume the parties are operating and using software programs and services in an environment where the operators declare themselves to be {UMA}-conforming and the parties formally agree (for example, in the form of contracts using these clauses) to such terms.</p><p>The technical system in which the clauses are encoded is called [CommonAccord], which "expresses legal relationships as 'objects,' like software". This allows for reusability of each clause, term, abbreviation, and component therein.</p><p>In this document, defined terms are shown in green, persons are shown in brown, and tokens (UMA technical artifacts) are shown in red.</p>
