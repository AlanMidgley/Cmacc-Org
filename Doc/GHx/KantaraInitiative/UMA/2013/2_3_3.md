Ti={Resource_Server_Operator}-{Authorization_Server_Operator}: Respect-Permissions

sec=When the {Resource_Server} successfully introspects a "bearer" {RPT}, the {Resource_Server_Operator} gains an obligation to the {Authorization_Server_Operator} to respect the permissions that the {Authorization_Server} has associated with the {RPT} when the {Resource_Server} subsequently allows or disallows access by the {Client} that presented that {RPT}.

Comments=The {Resource_Server_Operator}, as a {Subject} that is otherwise potentially not obligated to the {Authorization_Server_Operator}, carries a great deal of responsibility here not to allow access where the {Authorization_Server} has not granted permission and to make every effort to grant access where the {Authorization_Server} has granted permission. Its interpretation of scopes and permissions is not directly auditable by the {Authorization_Server}. Further, issues can arise from the skew between permission validity periods and actual access. Defining and using different {RPT} profiles can mitigate the risk of failure or malice on the {Resource_Server_Operator}'s part.
