Cov.After.3.1.Intro=As used in this Section {7.3}, the term "<span class="definedterm">Confidential Information</span>" includes any of the following information held or used by or relating to any <span class="definedterm">Acquired Company</span>

Cov.After.3.4.Sec=If any <span class="definedterm">Seller</span> becomes compelled in any <span class="definedterm">Proceeding</span> to make any disclosure that is prohibited by this Section {7.3}, such <span class="definedterm">Seller</span> shall, to the extent legally permissible, provide <span class="definedterm">Buyer</span> with prompt notice of such compulsion so that <span class="definedterm">Buyer</span> may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section {7.3}.  In the absence of a protective order or other remedy, such <span class="definedterm">Seller</span> may disclose that portion (and only that portion) of the <span class="definedterm">Confidential Information</span> that, based upon the opinion of such <span class="definedterm">Seller</span>'s counsel, such <span class="definedterm">Seller</span> is legally compelled to disclose; provided, however, that such <span class="definedterm">Seller</span> shall use its best efforts to obtain written assurance that any <span class="definedterm">Person</span> to whom any <span class="definedterm">Confidential Information</span> is so disclosed shall accord confidential treatment to such <span class="definedterm">Confidential Information</span>.

Cov.After.3.5.Sec=Nothing in this Section {7.3} will diminish the protections and benefits under applicable {Legal_Requirements} to which any Trade Secret of any <span class="definedterm">Acquired Company</span> is entitled.  If any information that an <span class="definedterm">Acquired Company</span> asserts to be a Trade Secret under applicable {Legal_Requirements} is found by a court of competent jurisdiction not to be such a Trade Secret, such information will nonetheless be considered <span class="definedterm">Confidential Information</span> of that <span class="definedterm">Acquired Company</span> for purposes of this Section {7.3}.
