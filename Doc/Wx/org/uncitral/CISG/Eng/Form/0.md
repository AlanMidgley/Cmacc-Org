4.Ti=Chapter IV. PASSING OF RISK

66.Ti=Article 66

66.sec=Loss of or damage to the goods after the risk has passed to the buyer does not discharge him from his obligation to pay the price, unless the loss or damage is due to an act or omission of the seller.

67.Ti=Article 67

67.1.sec=If the contract of sale involves carriage of the goods and the seller is not bound to hand them over at a particular place, the risk passes to the buyer when the goods are handed over to the first carrier for transmission to the buyer in accordance with the contract of sale. If the seller is bound to hand the goods over to a carrier at a particular place, the risk does not pass to the buyer until the goods are handed over to the carrier at that place. The fact that the seller is authorized to retain documents controlling the disposition of the goods does not affect the passage of the risk.

67.2.sec=Nevertheless, the risk does not pass to the buyer until the goods are clearly identified to the contract, whether by markings on the goods, by shipping documents, by notice given to the buyer or otherwise.

67.=[Z/ol/s2]

68.Ti=Article 68

68.sec=The risk in respect of goods sold in transit passes to the buyer from the time of the conclusion of the contract. However, if the circumstances so indicate, the risk is assumed by the buyer from the time the goods were handed over to the carrier who issued the documents embodying the contract of carriage. Nevertheless, if at the time of the conclusion of the contract of sale the seller knew or ought to have known that the goods had been lost or damaged and did not disclose this to the buyer, the loss or damage is at the risk of the seller.

69.Ti=Article 69

69.1.sec=In cases not within articles 67 and 68, the risk passes to the buyer when he takes over the goods or, if he does not do so in due time, from the time when the goods are placed at his disposal and he commits a breach of contract by failing to take delivery.

69.2.sec=However, if the buyer is bound to take over the goods at a place other than a place of business of the seller, the risk passes when delivery is due and the buyer is aware of the fact that the goods are placed at his disposal at that place.

69.3.sec=If the contract relates to goods not then identified, the goods are considered not to be placed at the disposal of the buyer until they are clearly identified to the contract.

69.=[Z/ol/s3]

70.Ti=Article 70

70.sec=If the seller has committed a fundamental breach of contract, articles 67, 68 and 69 do not impair the remedies available to the buyer on account of the breach.

Chapter V. PROVISIONS COMMON TO THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE SELLER AND OF THE BUYER

Section I. Anticipatory breach and instalment contracts

71.Ti=Article 71

71.1.0.sec=A party may suspend the performance of his obligations if, after the conclusion of the contract, it becomes apparent that the other party will not perform a substantial part of his obligations as a result of:

71.1.1.sec=a serious deficiency in his ability to perform or in his creditworthiness; or

71.1.2.sec=his conduct in preparing to perform or in performing the contract.

71.1.=[Z/ol-a/s2]

71.2.sec=If the seller has already dispatched the goods before the grounds described in the preceding paragraph become evident, he may prevent the handing over of the goods to the buyer even though the buyer holds a ­document which entitles him to obtain them. The present paragraph relates only to the rights in the goods as between the buyer and the seller.

71.3.sec=A party suspending performance, whether before or after dispatch of the goods, must immediately give notice of the suspension to the other party and must continue with performance if the other party provides ­adequate assurance of his performance.

71.=[Z/ol/s3]

72.Ti=Article 72

72.1.sec=If prior to the date for performance of the contract it is clear that one of the parties will commit a fundamental breach of contract, the other party may declare the contract avoided.

72.2.sec=If time allows, the party intending to declare the contract avoided must give reasonable notice to the other party in order to permit him to provide adequate assurance of his performance.

72.3.sec=The requirements of the preceding paragraph do not apply if the other party has declared that he will not perform his obligations.

72.=[Z/ol/s3]

73.Ti=Article 73

73.1.sec=In the case of a contract for delivery of goods by instalments, if the failure of one party to perform any of his obligations in respect of any instalment constitutes a fundamental breach of contract with respect to that instalment, the other party may declare the contract avoided with respect to that instalment.

73.2.sec=If one party’s failure to perform any of his obligations in respect of any instalment gives the other party good grounds to conclude that a fundamental breach of contract will occur with respect to future instalments, he may declare the contract avoided for the future, provided that he does so within a reasonable time.

73.3.sec=A buyer who declares the contract avoided in respect of any ­delivery may, at the same time, declare it avoided in respect of deliveries already made or of future deliveries if, by reason of their interdependence, those deliveries could not be used for the purpose contemplated by the ­parties at the time of the conclusion of the contract.

73.=[Z/ol/s3]

Section II. Damages

74.Ti=Article 74

74.sec=Damages for breach of contract by one party consist of a sum equal to the loss, including loss of profit, suffered by the other party as a consequence of the breach. Such damages may not exceed the loss which the party in breach foresaw or ought to have foreseen at the time of the conclusion of the contract, in the light of the facts and matters of which he then knew or ought to have known, as a possible consequence of the breach of contract.

75.Ti=Article 75

75.sec=If the contract is avoided and if, in a reasonable manner and within a reasonable time after avoidance, the buyer has bought goods in replacement or the seller has resold the goods, the party claiming damages may recover the difference between the contract price and the price in the substitute transaction as well as any further damages recoverable under article 74.

76.Ti=Article 76

76.1.sec=If the contract is avoided and there is a current price for the goods, the party claiming damages may, if he has not made a purchase or resale under article 75, recover the difference between the price fixed by the ­contract and the current price at the time of avoidance as well as any further damages recoverable under article 74. If, however, the party claiming ­damages has avoided the contract after taking over the goods, the current price at the time of such taking over shall be applied instead of the current price at the time of avoidance.

76.2.sec=For the purposes of the preceding paragraph, the current price is the price prevailing at the place where delivery of the goods should have been made or, if there is no current price at that place, the price at such other place as serves as a reasonable substitute, making due allowance for differences in the cost of transporting the goods.

76.=[Z/ol/s2]

77.Ti=Article 77

77.sec=A party who relies on a breach of contract must take such measures as are reasonable in the circumstances to mitigate the loss, including loss of profit, resulting from the breach. If he fails to take such measures, the party in breach may claim a reduction in the damages in the amount by which the loss should have been mitigated.

Section III. Interest

78.Ti=Article 78

78.sec=If a party fails to pay the price or any other sum that is in arrears, the other party is entitled to interest on it, without prejudice to any claim for damages recoverable under article 74.

Section IV. Exemptions

79.Ti=Article 79

79.1.sec=A party is not liable for a failure to perform any of his obligations if he proves that the failure was due to an impediment beyond his control and that he could not reasonably be expected to have taken the impediment into account at the time of the conclusion of the contract or to have avoided or overcome it, or its consequences.

79.2.0.sec=If the party’s failure is due to the failure by a third person whom he has engaged to perform the whole or a part of the contract, that party is exempt from liability only if:

79.2.1.sec=he is exempt under the preceding paragraph; and

79.2.2.sec=the person whom he has so engaged would be so exempt if the provisions of that paragraph were applied to him.

79.2.=[Z/ol-a/s2]

79.3.sec=The exemption provided by this article has effect for the period during which the impediment exists.

79.4.sec=The party who fails to perform must give notice to the other party of the impediment and its effect on his ability to perform. If the notice is not received by the other party within a reasonable time after the party who fails to perform knew or ought to have known of the impediment, he is liable for damages resulting from such non-receipt.

79.5.sec=Nothing in this article prevents either party from exercising any right other than to claim damages under this Convention.

79.=[Z/ol/s5]

80.Ti=Article 80

80.sec=A party may not rely on a failure of the other party to perform, to the extent that such failure was caused by the first party’s act or omission.

Section V. Effects of avoidance

81.Ti=Article 81

81.1.sec=Avoidance of the contract releases both parties from their ­obligations under it, subject to any damages which may be due. Avoidance does not affect any provision of the contract for the settlement of disputes or any other provision of the contract governing the rights and obligations of the parties consequent upon the avoidance of the contract.

81.2.sec=A party who has performed the contract either wholly or in part may claim restitution from the other party of whatever the first party has supplied or paid under the contract. If both parties are bound to make ­restitution, they must do so concurrently.

81.=[Z/ol/s2]

82.Ti=Article 82

82.1.sec=The buyer loses the right to declare the contract avoided or to require the seller to deliver substitute goods if it is impossible for him to make restitution of the goods substantially in the condition in which he received them.

82.2.0.sec=The preceding paragraph does not apply:

82.2.1.sec=if the impossibility of making restitution of the goods or of making restitution of the goods substantially in the condition in which the buyer received them is not due to his act or omission;

82.2.2.sec=if the goods or part of the goods have perished or deteriorated as a result of the examination provided for in article 38; or

82.2.3.sec=if the goods or part of the goods have been sold in the normal course of business or have been consumed or transformed by the buyer in the course of normal use before he discovered or ought to have discovered the lack of conformity.

82.2.=[Z/ol/s3]

82.=[Z/ol/s2]

83.Ti=Article 83

84.2.0.sec=The buyer must account to the seller for all benefits which he has derived from the goods or part of them:

84.2.1.sec=if he must make restitution of the goods or part of them; or

84.2.2.sec=if it is impossible for him to make restitution of all or part of the goods or to make restitution of all or part of the goods substantially in the condition in which he received them, but he has nevertheless ­declared the contract avoided or required the seller to deliver substitute goods.

84.2.=[Z/ol-a/s2]

84.=[Z/ol/s2]

Section VI. Preservation of the goods

85.Ti=Article 85

85.sec=If the buyer is in delay in taking delivery of the goods or, where payment of the price and delivery of the goods are to be made concurrently, if he fails to pay the price, and the seller is either in possession of the goods or otherwise able to control their disposition, the seller must take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to preserve them. He is entitled to retain them until he has been reimbursed his reasonable expenses by the buyer.

86.Ti=Article 86

86.1.sec=If the buyer has received the goods and intends to exercise any right under the contract or this Convention to reject them, he must take such steps to preserve them as are reasonable in the circumstances. He is entitled to retain them until he has been reimbursed his reasonable expenses by the seller.

86.2.sec=If goods dispatched to the buyer have been placed at his disposal at their destination and he exercises the right to reject them, he must take possession of them on behalf of the seller, provided that this can be done without payment of the price and without unreasonable ­inconvenience or unreasonable expense. This provision does not apply if the seller or a person authorized to take charge of the goods on his behalf is present at the destination. If the buyer takes possession of the goods under this ­paragraph, his rights and obligations are governed by the ­preceding paragraph.

86.=[Z/ol/s2]

87.Ti=Article 87

87.sec=A party who is bound to take steps to preserve the goods may deposit them in a warehouse of a third person at the expense of the other party provided that the expense incurred is not unreasonable.

88.Ti=Article 88

88.2.sec=If the goods are subject to rapid deterioration or their preservation would involve unreasonable expense, a party who is bound to preserve the goods in accordance with article 85 or 86 must take reasonable measures to sell them. To the extent possible he must give notice to the other party of his intention to sell.

88.3.sec=A party selling the goods has the right to retain out of the proceeds of sale an amount equal to the reasonable expenses of preserving the goods and of selling them. He must account to the other party for the balance.
