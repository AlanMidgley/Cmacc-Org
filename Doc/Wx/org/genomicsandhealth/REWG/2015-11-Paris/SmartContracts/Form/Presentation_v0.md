Ti=Smart Contracts and Machine Readable Consent<br>GA4GH - 2015-11-10


1.Ti=A blockchain-enable consent system:

1.1.sec=The consent is a few key/values.  Big things, e.g., an image or the genome itself, is stored off-chain, on IPFS or otherwise, and referenced by hash.

1.2.sec=The consent is signed by the Subject and the Researcher. 

1.3.sec=The form on which it is based is signed by the institution and supervisory authorities. 

1.4.sec=Based on materials signed by i) a national regulator, ii) research funders, iii) the GA4GH, iv) others.

1.5.sec=With each person and institution identified by handle.

2.Ti=Consequences

2.1.sec=A "mostly" machine-readable object model of the study, the field, the consent, the funding, everything one wants.  Mostly machine-readable because most of the information is metadata. Need to do NLP only for patches, and only until the patches have been tagged.

2.2.sec=Metadata approaches becoming the entire record.

2.3.sec=The critical contribution of blockchain is certainty.  That has many effects.

2.4.sec=Blockchains can be chained.  A system can be satisfied with just one original of each bit of information.  Copies can be discarded because the original is safe.  Shard, share, discard, recharge.

3.Ti=Smart Contracts

3.0.sec="Smart contracts" are bits of automation that run on a blockchain and add functionality to this picture:

3.1.Ti=Advantages

3.1.0.sec=Include:

3.1.1.sec=Open source.

3.1.2.sec=Consistent interface and functionality.

3.1.3.sec=Provable.

3.2.Ti=Examples

3.2.0.sec=The system can:

3.2.1.sec=Ask the Subject for permission to use, in a very granular way.

3.2.2.sec=Inform the Subject of each use.

3.2.3.sec=Provide credit to the researchers.

3.2.4.sec=Do billing.

3.2.5.sec=Make payments, in uncolored funds or colored funds.

What connection?


The moving pieces:



"Smart Contracts" are bits of automation that work on blockchains.  

Blockchains are secure channels of communication among some group of people.  

Like Email, but secure, with an accounting function.

And not necessarily under the control of any host.
