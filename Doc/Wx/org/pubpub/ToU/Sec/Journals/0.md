Ti={_Journals}

sec={Site.Handle} allows registered users to create "{_Journals}" that aggregate their own and other users' Pubs under a single page. A {_Journal} may reside on the {Site.Handle} domain or on a domain of the {_Journal} administrator's choice. In either case, the content displayed in the {_Journal}, including any Pubs, is displayed exclusively from a {Site.Handle} server. A {_Journal} administrator does not need the approval of a Pub's author in order to include the Pub on his or her page. You may submit your Pub for inclusion in a {_Journal}, but it is up to the {_Journal}'s administrator to decide whether to include it. {Site.Handle} displays in your profile a list of your Pubs and the {_Journals} in which they appear. We may also send you a notification each time a {_Journal} has elected to include your Pub, if you have opted in to receiving email from {Site.Handle}.
