NoteOrigin=Il conviendra de porter une attention particulière sur la dernière clause (xvi) concernant le départ d’un fondateur. S’agissant d’une décision extrêmement sensible à tous points de vue, il est suggéré qu’elle nécessite non seulement l’accord de la majorité des investisseurs mais aussi celle de tous les co-fondateurs actifs restants.
