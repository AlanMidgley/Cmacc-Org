Note=There seems to be something unusual going on in the use of capitalized terms.  They sometimes refer to defined terms (good), sometimes seem to refer to the names of items in the Summary (hmm) and sometimes to things that aren't defined here at all.  Perhaps they are defined elsewhere? "Cash Settlement Amount" is defined but not otherwise used.
