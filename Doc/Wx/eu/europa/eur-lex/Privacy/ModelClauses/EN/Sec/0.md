In that case, {_the_data_importer} warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the {_personal_data} transferred and will not actively {_process} the {_personal_data} transferred anymore.

12.2.sec={_The_data_importer} and the {_sub-processor} warrant that upon request of {_the_data_exporter} and/or of the {_supervisory_authority}, it will submit its data-{_processing} facilities for an audit of the measures referred to in paragraph 1.
