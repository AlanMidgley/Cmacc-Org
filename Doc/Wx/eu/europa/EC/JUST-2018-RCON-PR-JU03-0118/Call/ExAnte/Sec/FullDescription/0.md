Modelling the EU Economy as an Ecosystem of Contracts

Ti=Full description of the fields covered by the call for expressions of interest

0.sec=The fields relevant for this call include macroeconomic modelling, European (statistical) accounting frameworks, international data standards, internet technology with a focus on implications for the recording of economic trades, other internet-related technologies, as well as legal implications of data production and data custody in this context.

1.0.sec=We expect a report with two minor deliverables and one major deliverable.

1.1.1.sec=The first minor deliverable consists in a review of the relevant literature with a focus on preparing the discussion of the feasibility of the additional complementary view of the EU economy as an ecosystem of (legally enforceable) contractual relationships. The literature review (together with the second minor deliverable) ensures the stand-alone quality of the study.

1.1.2.sec=The review should ensure a basic understanding of the main features and assumptions, both from a historical and legal perspective of current modelling framework of economic activity underlying the central concept of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and its various sectoral accounting views, and should briefly explain tradeoffs involved in its main methodological choices. This item requires producing an overview of liability aspects of data modelling and data custody functions in the current framework.

1.1.=[G/Z/paras/s2]

1.2.sec=The second minor deliverable will outline how the internet has driven the emergence of a data-driven economy challenging the established modelling framework, historically tailored to the production and shipping of physical goods.
